      "\n",
      "Leaning out from a bridge leading into Wat Rong Khun, I squint at a stucco moat of outstretched hands and grisly skeletons. Two massive horns arch over the walkway, while a few steps ahead, giant statues of Death and Rahu guard the entrance, like burly bouncers poised to restrict my entry into heaven. “The bridge of rebirth,” I overhear a foreign couple talking. A swampland of desire—enslaved arms—lie in wait blocking a mortal’s road to nirvana. This was rebirth as an infernal spectre, not Elton John’s PG-13 “Circle of Life.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Chiang Rai’s White Temple could stand in for a gonzo Disney dream, a lakeside monument studded with fragmented mirrors blinking from every inch. Artist Chalermchai Kositpipat, its eccentric creator, draws heavily from manic surrealism. He also loves allegory. White signifies the Buddha’s purity; glass denotes his luminosity. The bridge opens into a vast main complex, a safe space for souls free of want. Besides the usual aspects of a shrine, I saunter past some oddball touches—replicas of Iron Man, ghouls hanging from trees and a golden lavatory.\n",
      "\n",
      "Inside the temple’s principal hall, Kositpipat’s unleashes his freakish vision to the hilt in imposing Buddhist murals, spiked with late 1990s/early 2000s mainstream culture and fired through a space cannon. My eyes scan cosmic battles, the Twin Towers aflame, Neo from The Matrix, Elvis Presley, Michael Jackson and the notorious big Bs (Bush and Bin Laden). It’s symbolism in overdrive. Not far from here the souvenir shop hawks these mural scenes on smaller prints. I make a beeline for it. Seeking a want, you might rightly deduce. My soul shrugs as the bridge beckons.\n",

      "It’s before dawn at Horizon Village & Resort, in the rural outskirts of Chiang Mai’s Doi Saket district, and I am biding my time with Supriya, a photographer and my travelling partner on this trip. We sip tea in near silence on the lawn out front. A crew of staffers pump two deflated hot-air balloons, burners spewing fire into their openings. Our pilot, clad in a blue T-shirt, sizes up his passengers. Pointing at me, he implies that lightweights will go last. Behind him I catch the other balloon lifting off, so we pile awkwardly into our basket. Within minutes, Thai Captain Kirk steers us off. As he tinkers with the burner, he reminds us, “Depending on the wind, we can go high or stay low.” We play it safe for nearly 15 minutes. My fingers are tracing the outlines below, a tranquil garden of rice field squares but just when I have a lay of the land, our commander accelerates and the ground blurs beneath my feet. Our goal is to witness the sun’s earliest rays light up the sky’s Rothko blues, which it does in a flashy few seconds. Back on earth, we return to the resort, where we are toasted like Formula One drivers. Instead of trophies, we receive certificates. Bemusement is writ large on our faces, when Captain Kirk, holding an uncorked bottle of bubbly in one hand, signals. I step forward. Bend your head, he says. I follow, waiting for champagne to rain on me. The drink hits my hair like an icy trickle washing down this morning’s warm glow.\n",

      "While the Bangkok Grand Palace is all glittering pagodas and coiffed greens, at Bhubing Palace, the royal family’s holiday estate, old-fashioned cottages peek out from hilly stilts, embraced by acres of lovely gardens. Anutree, our spry Chiang Mai guide, had chalked out half a day for our exploration. She kicks it off with a light trek to the Doi Suthep, a mountain in western Chiang Mai, a wonderful vantage point to enjoy the province’s lush wonder. After the exertion, Bhubing Palace is a breeze, ideal for a lazy reverie along rose and orchid-sprouting pathways. From Bhubing, we ride upwards again to Doi Pui tribal village; a refuge of the ethnic community Hmong. Anutree guides us into a the living quarters of an elderly Hmong woman, dressed in a hemp skirt, with rough silver hair bundled up in an knot. It’s a tiny thatched-roof hut with dirt flooring and no doors or rooms for any purpose. Utensils are piled in a corner, in a rubble, along with discarded wood. Anutree tries to make conversation with the lady but she simply stares as though we are from a faraway planet. Later at the tribal market where some Hmong villagers sell their handicrafts, I walk out with a pair of hemp boots, unable to shake that withered face with pale grey eyes from my memory.\n",

      "If northern Thailand history is your aim, then visit Chiang Mai National Museum, a fascinating collection detailing the region’s ancient Lanna kingdom and its antecedents. But my journey till now had included its fair share of gold-rimmed temple trails. So I am restless for a not-that-quaint experience. MAIIAM Museum of Contemporary Art in San Kampheang promises to be an outlier. At first though, my senses scramble at the museum’s low-key simplicity; lately they’ve been attuned to florid classical architecture. I enter a plain, long rectangular warehouse, its facade overhauled with rippling glass tiles, refracting playfully in the sun. Inside, Spartan gallery units house a permanent display and temporary exhibits on two floors. MAIIAM owes its repository to a family of private collectors with a taste for contemporary Thai works. Fortuitously, the art on its walls today alludes to timely subjects—migration, identity and exile.\n",

      "There’s an installation “IDPS,” by Jakkai Siributr, that unfolds on four textile tapestries, which honour stories of Hmong refugees in Thailand who escaped conflict in Laos. In the middle of the central hall, a huge vitrine demands my attention. This is the work of Sawangwongse Yawnghwe, a Burmese artist originally from Myanmar’s Shan state, also battered by a bloody past. I crouch by the glass encasing, my eyes registering little clay figurines, a caravan of travelling amulets. “Spirit Vitrines (Memoirs of a Shan Exile),” the description says, a sobering reminder that ghosts of a mass exodus can haunt one forever.\n",

      "I hadn’t the fuzziest notion about a traditional Lanna dinner, let alone the idea that it would be served in an open-air reception hall with almost 800 people being serenaded by pretty Thai women in ethnic attire. When we arrive at Khum Khantoke, inside a business park in Chiang Mai city, much of the ground seating circling the performance arena is already taken by hives of tourists and large family groups. Once the servers arrive bearing food, the steady hum of their incessant chatter subsides. Khantoke in Thai translates to a small dining tray with tinier bowls of food in it. Not at all difficult for an Indian to grasp—imagine a thali with the best of northern Thailand’s specialities. I can count eight bowls in my khantoke and, in one of them, the spicy chilli paste our guide had raved about earlier. The paste is to be eaten with steamed veggies but really, it can also be used as a side with the khantoke’s other dishes—minced pork in tomato sauce, dark red pork curry (also, Anutwree’s recommendation), banana fritters, sticky rice, fried rice noodles and crispy pork skin. Chowing down mouthfuls of pork crunch and chilli paste, I admire a bevy of women in gilded crowns swaying gracefully to classical Thai numbers. A slew of cultural variety acts follow, from dramatic war dances to mythical retellings. Even though riveted, minus any context, I am somewhat befuddled. As far as the khantoke goes, however, my taste buds deliver a standing ovation.\n",

      "Usually, I am not one to sign up for arduous outdoorsy plans if I can help it but hiking in Doi Inthanon National Park, home to Thailand’s tallest mountain at 2,565 feet, feels like a light refreshing sprint. Our guide is a chatty local man in khakhis wielding a tall wooden stick that he keeps occasionally tapping against trees and rocks, as if to scare away lurking spirits. “Majority of people here with Karen tribe,” he reveals in his broken accent. Members of the tribe farm for their sustenance and throughout the hike, our guide points out to terraced rice fields, coffee plantations and strawberry fields. We aren’t the only hikers this morning; groups of birders and backpackers squirm past us along narrow rocky climbs. Waterfalls interrupt the forest scenery from time to time and after we rest by one such gushing cascade, we tread back to the start and part with our hiking guide. Anutree says she knows a great lunch spot and so, we set off for Doi Inthanon Royal Project, which is a farming research endeavour patronised by Thailand’s royal family. “The royal project is a source of income for the tribes,” Anutree tells us, while shepherding us in and out of agricultural glasshouses with all kinds of produce growing inside them. And it is this bounty that is used to cook all the dishes at the Royal Project Kitchen, where we settle in for a meal. From our table, I take in the scenic panorama of Doi Inthanon stretched out below. That view alone is worth the price of admission, I concur.\n",

      "After a tiring snorkelling session in the clear waters of Koh Phangan, instructors Captain Pumpui and Captain Poo are shepherding me and five others on a private speedboat to nearby Bottle Beach for a picnic lunch of sandwiches, macarons and fruit juices. I am about 10-12 kilometres from Belmond Napasai’s lush tropical resort in Koh Samui, my home for the last day-and-a-half, and the sun is blindingly bright overhead. This is ideal snorkelling weather; we have had a field day gasping at eels and corals underwater. But the heat has stymied chatter on our boat.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, the aquamen on board won’t have any lull. Blasting dance numbers from the speakers, Pumpui swivels his hips throughout the ride, Shakira-style, exhorting us to join in. We muster a few, muted rhythmic claps. Sometimes he pulls faces through a snorkel mask and, in another instant, casually hangs from outside the boat window like an impertinent daredevil. When Pumpui tires, he steers the boat and Poo takes over as cheerleader. I crack a bemused smile at their relentlessly sunny Laurel & Hardy routine. Perhaps every resort should have a slapstick comedy pairing on hand to liven up spirits.\n",
      "\n",
      "***\n",
      "\n",
      "In Koh Samui, you can count as many luxury stays as the island’s ubiquitous coconut trees. I imagine a satellite map of its coastline would only show streams of beach umbrellas, striped towels and slope-roofed villas. Belmond Napasai, a 17-acre landscaped stretch situated in the north, has two things to recommend itself—a tasteful Thai countryside-inspired architecture that carves up enough spaces for repose, and a wonderfully unobtrusive atmosphere that allows every guest to be an island unto themselves.\n",
      "\n",
      "My room, a four-bedroom waterfront villa furnished in bamboo and sturdy wood with a central courtyard and an inviting pool, is utterly quiet; upon my arrival I pull back the balcony doors to let the sea’s gentle rumblings sneak in from time to time. For a moment, the set-up feels dauntingly sweeping—if I broke into an impromptu yell here, nary a leaf would flutter.\n",

      "A quick nap later, I saunter into Infinity, the resort’s lounge overlooking a freshwater zero-edge pool, which appears to be a favourite corner to commune for many guests. It’s dusk and the bar, right behind me, is open. I settle into a sofa with that resort cocktail staple, a pina colada. This is the best view in the house, with the water’s emerald green depths glinting at my eye, breeze rifling through open white tents on the lit-up beachfront below and tall balletic palm trees in the distance watching over the darkness. During my stay, I return to claim my seat here as often as possible.\n",

      "Mornings are opportune to set off on an ambling walk about the resort’s stunning and expansive grounds, embraced by tropical coconut and cashew groves, or schedule an appointment by the spa centre. On my third day, I emerge from a refreshing Thai massage, my limbs suitably twisted but so grateful. That night, my travel group meets the resort’s general manager, Jeroen Nettekoven, for an elaborate dinner at Lal Thai Restaurant. As the staff rolls in a scrumptious spread of spring rolls, satays and salads, Jeroen helpfully decodes what’s in front of us. I can’t get enough of the southern-style lamb gravy in shallots, peanuts and dark sauce and the sautéed morning glory, all served with fragrant, light rice, for the main course. Desserts present an even more delightfully difficult conundrum: we have a choice of Thai coconut layer cake, water chestnuts in coconut syrup and mango with sticky rice. By the time we conclude our meal, only the crumbs of the saccharine cake remain.\n",

      "Driving off from the resort, I rewind to my conversation with Jeroen, one afternoon, about the magnetic pull of Samui’s translucent sea. “Whenever I want a break from the resort, I take a boat and head off,” he had revealed, belying the tremendous strain of managing something that had the outward markers of serenity. “I am happy with those captains. They are colourful characters, no?” The mere thought of Pumpui and Poo unleashing their antics on a mild-mannered Jeroen is a perfect bookend to my blissed-out Samui adventure.\n",

      "As soon as a long, gleaming dark green train carriage, emblazoned with ‘Eastern & Oriental Express’ in engraved gold lettering slides into Hua Hin station, I feel a tinge of self-consciousness. Neither I nor my co-passengers from India are dressed for something this imperial. For the last hour, we have been milling about Hua Hin, Thailand’s oldest railway station—a quirky but fading royal artefact—in our baggy tees, jeans and dusty shoes, lugging backpacks and satchels. Once I hop aboard the train though, the air is less intimidating. While this is a majestic luxury locomotive boasting every accoutrement of refined sophistication, I see open, friendly faces in casual wear and summer hats.\n",
      "\n",
      "To be clear, our group is not actually travelling on the E&O Express, presently journeying between Singapore and Bangkok. We are only passing through, being shown around for a brief period by a senior manager in an impeccable grey suit. Launched in the 1990s, the Express’s carriages originally belonged to another train called the Silver Star, but they have now been refitted to reflect Indochina’s fine artistry and its Western past. We are in the train’s bar area, where both style elements compete for attention: the walls and flooring appear to evoke a colonial-era, upper-class gentlemen’s club with tanned teak wood panels. And then, there are more decorative finishes, which nod to Asian designs, from the train’s silken upholstery to its intricate marquetry on furnishings. Outside, Hua Hin’s landscape scrolls by, framed by windows, like a scene from a TV screen. The comfortable sofa-style seating is separated in the middle by a compact side table with an antique lamp. Reclining in one of the seats, I sense the appeal of spending a few hours catching a snooze with a half-read paperback resting on my lap.\n",

The drink is there for our taking but there isn’t any time for tasting and we hurry on to the dining car for a meal cooked by the train’s chef Yannis Martineau. I dig into some duck that’s spiced in dark local sauces but retains the classic delicacy of French cooking; even dessert, usually a rich amalgam of milk, fruit and coconut in Thai meals, has a lightness to it.\n",
      "\n",
      "When passengers want to come up for air, they head to the Express’s observation car at its far end. En route, we pass a hallway of closed doors, our guide identifying them as sleeper cabins. For fans of Agatha Christie, the stuffy passage should jog a memory. After all, the Express was a backdrop for one of her most famous mysteries, finally unlocked by Hercule Poirot and his moustache twirl. Christie’s iconic work cemented the train as a world of slinky glamour, full of fashionable cloche-hatted beauties, imposing English dames and debonair playboys.\n",
      "\n",
      "The observation car is a beautiful wooden cabin with yellow lights on the ceiling. As we enter, it is busy. A well-heeled Chinese brood—grandparents, aunts, uncles and their young ones—has lined up against the main window to capture that elusive perfect family shot. Some guests are here for their post-lunch reverie. Some folks immediately can’t resist bringing out their cameras but most people appear glad to do nothing except watch the Express move through an unspoiled Thai countryside.\n",
      "\n",
      "It’s a prized view, all right, but is it worth a few thousand dollars? Aren’t there mountains to scale or planes to skydive out of for that kind of cash? I recall observing a tall blond American in the dining car on a table across the aisle, gently chatting with his grandfather, all shaky jowls and quivering fingers. The chef had stopped by their table to enquire, “Are you liking the food?” The old man, for whom speech had become an impediment, beamed a toothless smile that could light up the whole compartment. For his delighted grandson, that was a timeless payoff.\n",

      "The world’s greatest cities are brutal, unsentimental places, precisely the reason why so many of us fall so irrevocably under their spell. In its worst hour, this bond can curdle into bitter complaints of unrequited affection and everyday torment. “The subway doesn’t work, trash is overflowing and it’s too crowded; this is over.” Let me assure you that right now someone somewhere is uttering these words about your dream metropolis, New York, Rome, Rio De Janeiro. Like an unrepentant cad, the city laughs in their face, “Go on… live without me.” Wresting long-term connections comes with the occasional pang of nostalgic regret. Those who can’t escape their love of cities are destined to keep replaying that first flush of romance, that moment when a city went from a destination to home.\n",
      "\n",
      "A traveller’s sense of a city is always ephemeral. Not that this discredits his or her insights but to genuinely get under the skin of a modern metropolis, we look towards its people, leaning against its sidewalks, reading in café nooks or flirting in nightclubs. One of the best descriptions of city love I’ve read is in a wonderful book on London with a rather circuitous moniker: Londoners: The Days And Nights Of London Now—As Told By Those Who Love It, Hate It, Live It, Left It, And Long For It. In it writer Craig Taylor, who lived in the British capital for years, recalls relocating to Toronto and fielding that pesky question, “How do you feel about London?” He had a complicated answer, “It wasn’t a two-way relationship. It was no use thinking this place loses any sleep over me.”\n",
      "\n",
      "That’s the messy conundrum of a great city, as experienced by its besotted paramours, some of whom can’t kick the habit even if they tried. Travellers attempting to understand an urban jungle are better off trying to study its undercurrents. In September’s ode to five global cities, NGTI attempts to get a measure of their pulse. A writer dives into Belfast’s turbulent past to fully grasp its present-day vibrancy, another digs into the back alleys of Kuala Lumpur’s inimitable heritage food joints.

For years, Mount Everest inspired a sense of forbidden majesty, which was surmounted only by a few courageous adventurers. It helped that they were entertaining and we were content to immerse ourselves in the stories they wove from these monumental expeditions.\n",
      "\n",
      "In 2019, life-changing experiences are more easily found. This is probably why, when a photo of tourists lined up outside Everest’s summit, as though it were some check-in counter at an airport dispensing visas, was widely debated three months ago, the overwhelming emotion was deflated acceptance. No one in this day and age will be denied their Edmund Hillary moment.\n",
      "\n",
      "In February, the New York Times ran a panicked headline about another solitary paradise, which had long been removed from sustained tourist interference—the Galápagos. “Going to the Galápagos Is Easier and Cheaper Than Ever. That Might Not Be a Good Thing,” it warned. According to the article, “in 2017, 2,41,800 people visited the islands, up from 1,73,419 a decade earlier.”\n",
      "\n",
      "I am not highlighting these concerns as a spoilsport to anyone’s dreams. Travellers have earned their right to be wherever they choose to be. Even more so, seeking out the elusive is neither new nor groundbreaking; people were born of this earthly garden and returning to its comforting delights is the most primal of escapes. But the irony of how long we have this profusion of wilderness has not been lost, especially while we look towards the outdoors for constant nourishment and inspiration.\n",
      "\n",
      "Despite the arguments in favour or against these developments, NGTI’s August edition remains an ode to bona fide outdoor enthusiasts, a sincere testament to how faraway mountains, hidden islands, sweeping canyons continue to wield a magnetic pull over us. We have packed this issue with epic journeys: a 10-day road trip from Iceland’s deep grey volcanic outback, a tropical joyride in Fiji, a playful encounter with wildlife in New Zealand and a first-time skier’s tentative venture onto the slopes of Tahoe.\n",
      "\n",
      "While enjoying these wonderful reads, try to think of that sagacious advice, often doled out when restlessness sneaks its dreary head—“Why not go outside? Get some fresh air?” The outdoors are great for us, this much has been proven. The question now is, can we be great for the outdoors too?\n",

      "Searching For Our Pop Culture Gods\n",
      "\n",
      "In this modern agnostic world, pop culture is the closest thing we have to a shared religion. Matinee idols, artists and rock stars are our gods and goddesses, feeding us an endless supply of enchanting lore and myths. For this movement to thrive though, it needs fans; followers who have gone beyond aloof observation. Pop culture requires that fans click below to subscribe, not let it just play in the background.\n",
      "\n",
      "One of my favourite explorations of fandom is Almost Famous, Cameron Crowe’s amusing semi-autobiographical movie about a wide-eyed teen writer and music geek, William, who receives the assignment of a lifetime when a magazine commissions him to join his beloved rock band on the road. William’s mentor is Lester Bangs, a senior critic with a hilarious zeal for mainstream culture. Lester would often launch into passionate defences of popular music, and a few lines from one fiery soliloquy, delivered to William in a diner, have always stayed with me. “The day it ceases to be dumb is the day it ceases to be real. Right? And then it will just become an Industry of Cool.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Pop culture is the industry of joy, I like to think. Its idols make our lives immeasurably more tolerable. We carry their songs in us, we live inside the fables they create. Sometimes, we travel to be reminded of them. Or other times, they recreate the places for us. Children of the nineties probably bought into two exaggerated but equally popular versions of New York, depending on what they watched—Friends or Seinfeld. If you grew up glued to the former, you thought the Big Apple was a city full of broke singletons who spent endless hours in coffee shops, cracking wise. If it was the other, your New York was a place with impatient eccentrics out to steal your soup recipe.\n",
      "\n",
      "In NGTI’s seventh anniversary edition, pop culture is the dominant conversation—travelling to relive the stories of famous movie stars, musicians, chefs and authors, to seek out their influences in the places they loved, from Colombia to Vietnam. Our contributors have handpicked their deities—Anthony Bourdain, Don Draper, The Beatles, Harry Potter, Shah Rukh Khan, among 18 names. We are true believers in these men, women and characters. Travelling in their shadow feels wonderful, delirious and appropriate. If this issue comes off as an unapologetic love fest, that’s entirely accurate. As Lester would put it, we are righteously dumb and hopelessly uncool.\n",

      "A Bombay Classic That Endures\n",
      "\n",
      "New and exciting has always received top billing in food—the latest fad, the newest restaurant, the trendiest neighbourhood, the healthiest diet. Often, these developments are accompanied by breathless pundit-like pronouncements: Lebanese is the new Chinese; Chinese is new Italian (wait, where does leave that Italian then?) A cuisine or dish has a moment, peaks and then becomes passé.\n",
      "\n",
      "While there is no shortage of cover versions, originals stand the test of time. And at National Geographic Traveller India, we confess to being partial to one classic. Creating and editing magazines in this day and age, with limited or, sometimes, binding resources, is a mental endurance test. Nothing makes the looming pressures more palatable than food. It is always on our mind. What gets us through the final sweaty hours, month after month, is an absolute Bombay fixture—the vada pav. We are a group of ardent foodies, and the deadline-hour vada pav toast is our modest tradition. Vada pavs are to Mumbai what hot dogs are to New York. Naysayers can knock the street staple all they want but we, at the magazine, are quite misty-eyed about our Bombaiya tastes.\n",
      "\n",
      "And for our collective money, there is no vada pav that quite matches Ashok Vada Pav, or the Kirti College vada pav, as it is casually referred to. The choice might feel obvious to insiders but it is well deserved. Vada pavs are simple—stick a fried potato ball with a sweet scintillating chutney in a fluffy bun; what can go wrong? But Ashok Vada Pav punches up with the zingiest combination of sauces and just the right cook on the vada, and tops it off with the showstopper—crispy fried crumbs of batter. Think of it as vada pav with fries.\n",
      "\n",
      "My thoughts on the vada pav can get more mawkish and graphic but suffice it to say that the pleasures of food are timeless. All the features in this month’s edition, from Pondicherry, Los Angeles, all over Europe, Laos and New Zealand, recall this essential aspect of travel. Regular readers can pick up any edition of our magazine and confirm our dedication to food. Our writers go to wondrous locations and more often than not, they return with stories of food, of how a single bite opened a fascinating world to them. Once a year, we devote our energy into creating a singular edition where ‘good food’ is not the sideshow of journeys. For that special issue, taste doesn’t seem incidental to storytelling, the spotlight follows it everywhere it goes.\n",

      "Redefining #Goals\n",
      "\n",
      "Once-in-a-lifetime is an overused expression in travel. Like everything else, the phrase has succumbed to a culture of instant hype. When every mountain hike, underwater dive or local meal is described with the glowing praise that should be meant for only the rarest of occurrences, it is difficult to tell a wonderful experience from a bucket list one. A bucket list just doesn’t translate with the same impact it was originally intended for.\n",
      "\n",
      "Why not reclaim the bucket list from this ordinariness? Travel goals, or at least the ones we file away under impossible, are defined by their incredulity. I would even go so far to suggest that if you don’t get laughed out of the room for your travel bucket list, you are doing something wrong. If it’s birthed in your imagination, why the restraint?\n",
      "\n",
      "A bucket list must elicit deep, almost-defeatist sighs or faraway looks. The appropriate response to photos of Arctic glaciers or Patagonian hikes is a sharp catch in your breath. It’s a recognition that as out of reach as a place seems, nothing can stop you from dreaming about getting there. It is poor little Charlie Bucket yearning that one day a strange man would welcome him into his outlandish chocolate factory.\n",
      "\n",
      "I empathise with Charlie because my earliest bucket list ideas were fictional too. As a kid, Tintin’s life of adventurous sleuthing across the globe seemed precious enough to envy. Adolescence was often spent in the thrall of Ray Bradbury’s stories from Mars. Adulthood, however, came with approachable aspirations and a Martian colony escapade was relegated to the fantastic realm. As time passes, bucket lists acquire a sort of silliness, like love letters from our past do, and many of us are content to keep them locked away, deep in our heart’s vaults.\n",
      "\n",
      "This month’s edition will hopefully dust the cobwebs off your bucket lists. If you have been lucky enough to tick off your dream destinations, then it may throw up new suggestions to start working towards. Either way, our compilation of 21 Journeys of a Lifetime does not take the word “lifetime” lightly. Sports fans can look forward to our guide to exploring England and Wales at the height of this year’s Cricket World Cup. Our treasure-island narrative from Fiji brims with enchantment, while more sophisticated types can dine off our drool-worthy dispatch from Dubai’s most extravagant hotel.\n",
      "\n",
      "As for my bucket list, I hope to enjoy the earthly delights of a winter in Saint Petersburg someday. Until Elon Musk fixes the Mars problem, of course.\n",

      "Why Our Forests Need Watching\n",
      "\n",
      "J R.R. Tolkien was right to portray the Ents, hulking pieces of tall barks with sad eyes and mossy facial hair who guarded forests, as perhaps the most stoic figures in his Lord of the Rings trilogy. Their whole manner spoke to an endurance that seemed constantly on the verge of dissipation. They had seen and tolerated far too much in a world at war with itself. Yet they remained calm, like a steady lighthouse in torrential downpour.\n",
      "\n",
      "Treebeard, the oldest of these Ents, makes one of the wisest observations about Middle Earth and, if any of us think about it today, our Earth too. “I am not altogether on anybody’s side because nobody is altogether on my side…Nobody cares for the woods as I care for them.” I imagine his weary resignation is shared by this great planet’s animals and birds, especially its wild inhabitants.\n",
      "\n",
      "I’ll confess I have never been completely at ease in the jungle. I have enjoyed my few visits to national parks and sanctuaries but at the end of them, I have come away feeling like an intruder at a party, where no one approves of my appearance.\n",
      "\n",
      "But I do recognise that being in the wild is something everyone should attempt at least once in their lives. Notice how travellers on a forest safari often start unwittingly mimicking animal behaviour. They adopt stealthy stances behind thickets, sharply snap their necks about at the slightest indication of any movement or stand alert as if awaiting some imaginary clarion call. All this for a fleeting glimpse of a creature, who is either startled or unsettled by their presence. Animals are levellers; if we want to see them, it’s only fair we play by their rules.\n",
      "\n",
      "Chasing a wild animal also never succumbs to a pattern. Each time the excitement is unique, the story entirely unscripted and the heart, pounding and fully alive. Now, given what we know about the existential threats facing wildlife in the future, that experience is bound to be poignant too.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our wildlife special is packed with a slew of adventurous escapades from the woods, like two enthusiasts trailing the reclusive snow leopard in Ladakh and a writer looking back on the refreshing, quiet and unexpected thrills of Jim Corbett National Park. Some narratives shine light on getaways in crowded urban crawls such as wildlife hotspots in London. Others discover that forgotten tribes in India’s central parts are its finest sentinels. So yes, wildlife deserves to be seen thriving in its natural habitat. Go tiger-spotting, deer chasing or birding. As Treebeard said, the woods need all the watchers it can get.\n",

      "A Soulmate for Summer\n",
      "\n",
      "Every summer, the pastoral call of their motherland, Kerala, beckoned my parents. Their children would plead that they change direction at least for one year but these entreaties were dismissed as flakiness. Summer months were set in stone. And contrary to the breezy, game-for-anything attitude that the sun induced in many folks, for my mother and father, it was a season for constancy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kids, however, are enamoured of the new and for that reason my face developed a serious case of the ‘summer scowl’ for our family’s month-long sojourn away from the city. I held on to it as if it were my most precious accessory. Even in the midst of unbridled fun—summer in Kerala has a disarming way of wearing down the staunchest defences and a person can only sulk so much—I was quick to plaster the scowl back on. Any sign that I was enjoying myself would only encourage my parents’ loyalist tendencies, I figured.\n",
      "\n",
      "These days, my summers are as free as they can be. With providence and resources on my side, I could just as well spin the globe and pick a spot to summer at. But in the last few years, I have been searching for a tradition of my own making. Granted, the season is an exciting time of possibilities and a cue to throw caution to the wind. The unbearably same-old, same-old is made slightly not so, if only through temporary escape. As some of you would suggest, there’s no need to stay rooted in summer.\n",
      "\n",
      "Why this quest for a ritualistic journey to one place then? As light and frothy as summer is made out to be, it has long been associated with routines. Caucasians descending on Bali for their annual surf-and-yoga retreat, millennials on a camping trip to the Western Ghats, elderly couples heading to Mussoorie for a respite from the heat or die-hard road warriors planning their yearly summit to the mountains are all creatures of seasonal habit. Everyone has their go-to destination and it’s one where they try to create an idyllic alternate universe.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some of our readers may already have their summers planned. I imagine there are those, who will be following paths they have tread before. For others, NGTI’s summer issue has much to choose from—a scrumptious gelato-sampling feast in Italy, a charming rustic getaway on a Ratnagiri farm, an immersive trip to the holy land in Jerusalem and an artsy trail of Monet’s favourite haunts in Normandy, France. Perhaps, by the end of this summer, we would have found a place to call our own, a refuge to return to over and over.\n",
      "\n",
      "How Deep Is Your Travel Love?\n",
      "\n",
      "If there is a phrase I would prefer to retire from online bios, personal or professional, it is, “I love travel.” Or some approximation of that sentiment. To clarify, I am not against travellers or those who proudly flaunt their passion for travel. On the contrary, editing a travel magazine has now made me oddly protective of travellers and their ilk. My submission is that “love to travel,” suggested so casually, just doesn’t feel adequate to the depth of emotion it sparks in true devotees.\n",
      "\n",
      "In February, the month of love as endowed by our great gifting industrial complex, we are wrestling with what “love for travel” means in tangible, life-affecting terms. The early throes of discovering travel might not be too dissimilar to the beginnings of a feverish affair. A fleeting scene, sound or feeling that at first arouses, then enchants and eventually, lures us into a hypnotic state, evoking woolly-eyed reveries about what could be.\n",
      "\n",
      "This world, however, is not the most conducive for long-term passion, the kind that demands unflinching sustenance in the midst of distractions from a thousand notifications. Passion has many rivals to contend with. And in flippantly announcing travel as our first love, we are not fully considering the influence our other paramours (work, relationships or money) exert on us.\n",
      "\n",
      "Travellers for life are compulsive. They have to be; there is no other existence. Climate change, marriages, deaths, protests and politics might have to take a backseat. I am reminded of a wanderlust-happy couple that discovered chinks in their relationship during a road trip through Russia. The woman, upset and distraught, offered a solution: cut the trip short to come back home and rekindle their chemistry. The man, however, wouldn’t give up Siberia, despite a chance at a do-over. Please don’t go getting any ideas about breaking hearts but for some travellers, marital bliss too has its limits.\n",
      "\n",
      "In finding stories about travel as a lifetime affair, we looked for longevity. We chose accounts of love, which tempered by the prospect of actually living, may have assumed a subdued tenor. But it only took a remembrance or flicker to fan the ardour all over again. One budding artist writes of her admiration for Frida Kahlo, and a Frida-inspired pilgrimage to Mexico. One of our own staffers takes a mental journey back to the cities and countries that have bookmarked her blossoming long-distance affection while a mountaineer outlines why the solitude of the Himalayas will never fail to captivate her.\n",
      "\n",
      "Falling in love with travel is much like falling in love with a song. You wear it out until it makes you sick. But you have to be foolish and always full of song.\n",

      "Travel Inspiration for 2019 : A Book on Nietzsche and Hiking\n",
      "\n",
      "One of the finer books I read this year was John Kaag’s Hiking With Nietzsche, in which Kaag, a professor of philosophy, rekindles his passion for the German thinker while tracing picturesque hiking trails in the mountains of Switzerland. It’s a near-precise rendering of the travelogue as a self-help book. A young Kaag was an avowed Nietzsche acolyte but given the ravages of responsibilities and adulthood, the writer put his affinity to test by undertaking physically enduring hikes through the Alps, revisiting haunts that the philosopher escaped to, in search of solitude and salve. The journey’s demands, coupled with his own inner turmoil, are catnip for anybody feeling at cross purposes with their own life.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the book, Kaag quotes Neitzsche writing to his mother after he had spent time in Splügen, “I was overcome by the desire to remain here… this high alpine valley… There are pure, strong gusts of air, hills and boulders of all shapes… But what pleases me the most are the splendid highroads over which I walk for hours.” Travel as the answer to searching questions is hardly a radical idea but what’s endearing about the book is that it subtly confirms a basic tenet of why we go on these journeys in the first place. Sometimes, being on the move matters more than anything else. Meandering through his hikes with his wife and child, Kaag faces endangering moments. He doesn’t always accomplish what he set out to do. “Slipping” is as important as climbing, he insists, and he persists.\n",
      "\n",
      "Travel writing’s bogeyman, I have been told again and again, is the Internet. Information and narrative are in abundance from tourists traversing to parts of the world that were once inaccessible with frequency. Where to go, how to go there, and what to do once a person is there is now easily definable. And if more catastrophic visions of the future are to be believed, one day an algorithm will do it better than any of us.\n",
      "\n",
      "What must then a travelogue accomplish? Kaag’s book reminded me that it was to establish an intimate and immediate human connection to a place. This can never be rated highly enough. Travel is as much about geography as it is about people, in lands that don’t inhabit our minds as often. It’s an urgent hammer taken to the numbing solipsism and drudgery that modern living descends into. It is storytelling, which never gets old.\n",
      "\n",
      "As another year dawns, NGTI has an exhaustive compendium of places, beloved and obscure, from across India and the world that should find its way to any adventurer’s 2019 itinerary. Travel, for all its ubiquity, still has plenty of seduction left in it.\n",
      "\n",
      "What Dreams May Come\n",
      "\n",
      "Our year-end edition toasts ultra-indulgence while travelling, featuring itineraries that many will know to be out of their financial reach. In producing these narratives, I was struck by a contrast.\n",
      "\n",
      "Travel today is dominated by minimalists or downsizers, those who preach the gospel of “hard-knock wanderlust.” And they almost always reap universal admiration. They are characters to aspire to, examples of made-for-Instagram sayings such as, “All you need is a backpack” or “#MotorcycleDiaries.” Unable to join these gallivanting philosophers, others marvel at their brave rebellion—oh, to give up the predictability of overpriced tourist traps someday, they sigh.\n",
      "\n",
      "In this context, luxury travel evokes a Molotov cocktail of feelings. A billionaire on a sailboat hosting Jazz Age-style revelries in the French Riviera is inevitably setting himself up for mockery. The heiress, who flits off to shopping holidays in Milan and Dubai, might as well buy an extra pair of sunglasses for the shade directed her way. Extravagance passes muster if it panders to affordability. In the last few years, it has become intertwined with entitlement, a radioactive pejorative today.\n",
      "\n",
      "Upper-class travel doesn’t deserve this slight. As more astute aesthetes have reminded us in the past, refined tastes don’t have to be gauche. Living like royalty might have its privileges but it also spurs a temperament for beauty, grace and sensuality, which is why travellers will always fork out top penny for a night in Rajasthan’s many palace stays.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wealth facilitates the kind of understated exclusivity seen in the English countryside’s several castles or manors, once a venue for elegant ballroom dances. Luxury could also simply mean time well spent—or doing nothing—floating atop a sundeck in an unending stretch of the ocean.\n",
      "\n",
      "Professional travel writers are lucky to be granted access to these private paradises and, in December’s magazine, a handful of them have returned with colourful dispatches. One writer enjoys a happy recreational bubble in the Maldives, another is privy to up close views of big game in Botswana. There is also a roundup of New York’s elite food and drinking haunts, and coverage of the maiden cruise between Mumbai and Goa. All these retreats promise a hedonistic binge: grand feasts of fine wine and champagne, and views hidden from the typical trails.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some of them will test your purse-strings but think of Holly Golightly. She couldn’t lay claim to real Tiffany’s jewels but that never stopped her from getting her heart’s fill, standing outside the window.\n",
      "\n",
      "Free on the Outside\n",
      "\n",
      "The great outdoors, around which our November edition pivots, is a deceptive catch-all, as such phrases tend to be. In day-to-day conversations, anything from after-school camping trips to sailing in the waters of Papua New Guinea risks being lumped in the same breath. But whoever put their mind to the term was no doubt thinking of great with a capital G. They were dreaming of outdoors that offer as much dislocation as possible. Where snow peaks rise out of clouds and canyons plunge the recesses of the earth.\n",
      "\n",
      "Geoff Dyer, one of travel journalism’s finest exponents, calls this a “sense of elsewhere.” Writing of an aunt, who sent him postcards from the southwest of America when he was in school, he recalls, “Hilda sent me brochures from places like the Painted Desert, the Petrified Forest and Monument Valley. These were landscapes I had glimpsed in Westerns, but the fact that someone I knew had been to them—had proved that they were real—gave me my first real sense of elsewhere.”\n",
      "\n",
      "My elsewhere memory from childhood doesn’t conjure anywhere near the same eloquence but it was just as resonant. One of my father’s favourite films was David Lean’s Lawrence of Arabia, perhaps a result of spending over a decade in the Middle East. He often sent long letters from his travels and, in one of them, he mentioned setting eyes on the desert for the first time, and feeling as if he was having his own T. E. Lawrence moment.\n",
      "\n",
      "Years later, watching the classic was an equally transporting experience. Each time, Lean’s camera dissolved from close-ups of Peter O’Toole’s mysteriously phlegmatic Lawrence to the sunlit sand dunes, bleeding out of the 70mm screen as it were, the impact was transcendent. For me, the desert was as elementally stark as outdoors got, Martian in its unfamiliarity and removed from all modern signifiers of life.\n",
      "\n",
      "Narratives dedicated to the outdoors must, therefore, pin down what it is like to be swept up in the enormity of nature. In this issue, trekkers will identify with one writer’s exultations at the end of her journey to the Everest Base Camp. A mind-expanding immersion in Australia’s Northern Territory is peppered with characters who gave up urban comforts for a life in the wild.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the less-frequented parts of Yellowstone National Park, another solo traveller descends into solitude. We also encounter a different Hong Kong, hiding green bounty beyond its skyline. Somerset Maugham believed that the wise traveller only travelled in his or her imagination. It’s true, the latter is unmatched but even a fevered imagination can only be nourished from being in the great outdoors.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the Mood for Winter\n",
      "\n",
      "Summer is a charming flirt. Easy-going and casual. Summer doesn’t huff and puff to win our affections. It has us at “Hello.” Winter broods like the tortured protagonist of big fat Russian novel. It is daunting and dramatic, burning with a slow intensity.\n",
      "\n",
      "The season’s reputation precedes itself, and often, not in a good way. It has a way of whittling down everything to its bare bones. Even relationships not attuned to its ebbs and flows can fray. At a dinner conversation I once attended, I listened in bemusement as a recent divorcee made the case that it was the Scandinavian frost that had cooled his ex-wife’s ardour. How original.\n",
      "\n",
      "Winter travel is an exercise in negotiation, especially for sunshine souls. “How many extra clothes do I have to pack now?” “The weather is minus-what-did-you-say?” All valid concerns but the recommendations far outweigh them. Take one trivial scoring point: the winter wardrobe, which is tres chic, and can make the most sartorially challenged among us look like runway models.\n",
      "\n",
      "The allure of winter lies in nature—so immense, overwhelming and, of course, achingly beautiful. In his collection of letters to an unborn daughter, Norwegian Karl Ove Knausgård meditates on the sounds of the season. “The screech of a crow, for instance, which in summer is just one note in a greater tapestry of sound, is in winter allowed to fill the air alone, and every single nuance in its rasping, hoarse, seemingly consonant-filled caws stands out.” Winter’s silences are missives from a distant world, electric and profound.\n",
      "\n",
      "Solitary revelations aside, winter can match summer for convivial fun. Think of Yuletide. Is there a more exuberant time of the year? To me, it’s the greatest incentive to plan a December trip to the west. To experience Christmas in its festive splendour, in all the clichés from postcards and fairy-tales.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our October edition has delightful winter escapes, spanning some of the prettiest landscapes in Europe. Finland is an underrated joyride, marked by reindeer rides and an unforgettable trip to catch the Northern Lights. In the Swedish city of Gothenburg, a Delhiite grapples with the quirks of winter anew. Paris in December remains the lovers’ rapturous fever dream while Copenhagen is a dizzying array of winter activities. In addition to which, an amateur and a professional offer differing accounts of skiing in Switzerland and Gulmarg.\n",
      "\n",
      "Unlike summer, winter is not a flash in the pan. But if those great novels of the past are any indication, you will get lost in the story of winter with every page you turn.\n",

      "Slow Days, Fast Company\n",
      "\n",
      "In the mid-2000s, I had the first of my several brushes with unemployment. This was no well-considered sabbatical. Instead it was a surprise shove that came out of nowhere. Losing a job is crushing but even more so if you are the only one. In the company of a few colleagues though, your shoulders droop less and the gloom takes on a lightheaded spin. You cloak despair in disdain, adopting a “What, me worry?” face. And then, you blot the world, and travel.\n",
      "\n",
      "So I accompanied one of my friends back to her hometown, Guwahati, where I was to join her mum and dad on a road journey to Shillong, and if the weather held steady, onward to Cherrapunji. The choice of Cherrapunji puzzled me initially for as far as I could tell, it was that place where it rained constantly. There were enough clouds hanging over me, I thought to myself.\n",
      "\n",
      "But since my arrival, my friend’s father, who is no more, had been keen on us travelling by road. He was a looming presence, with a fondness for fine booze and house parties. I remember that trip now in snatches—Guwahati (quiet and hilly), Shillong (cool long before cool was invented), homemade khao suey, bootleg liquor shacks along the border between Assam and Meghalaya, and a worn-out CD of Vivaldi in the car.\n",
      "\n",
      "The overwhelming memory I have though is of the Shillong-Guwahati highway, where locals peered out of tin-roofed houses and roadside shops hid culinary delights I had never encountered. And my host, stepping on the gas as if his modest SUV were an Italian speed monster. Driving unfettered always unleashed his inner outlaw, my friend would recall later.

      "That’s why NGTI always celebrates a breadth of road experiences. Some, featured in this issue, are familiar, like a bike ride through the outskirts of Barcelona, a family holiday in Australia and a jaunt through ancient Greece. Others, like a van ride through Mongolia and a illustrator’s perspective of the Californian coast, are utterly singular.\n",

      "I like a bit of pow-wow in any place. Let me rephrase before you think I am eternally hankering for a fight. What I mean is I would choose crooked streets over straight highways, sweaty mayhem over pristine elegance. This is why no matter where I go in this world, coming home to India, and especially Bombay, is never dull. I blame growing up in the city for my pugilistic predilections. One of the many descriptors that Mark Twain used in relation to Bombay was “pow-wow.” The place seemed to confound him: “Bewitching”, “Bewildering”, “Enchanting”, “Arabian Nights come again?”—the man was repulsed and riveted at the same time. It was a place befitting the number of exclamations he used.\n",
      "\n",
      "At 13, I was yet to be permitted the pleasures of travelling unchaperoned outside Bombay but within its confines, I had free rein to indulge my inner flâneur. I became the weekend loafer, slacking through parts of the city I really had no business being in. My itinerary hardly ever changed: Take the BEST bus to Chowpatty; after filling up on chaat, sample some more at the khau gully in Churchgate; sometimes, pretend to shop for music I could not afford at Kala Ghoda’s Rhythm House, where the desperately-trying-to-be-hip hung out in the 1990s. The final stretch was always my favourite: trudging along to my personal Shangri-La, Victoria Terminus.\n",

      "At VT, I parsed the sea of faces. I drummed up mind games to fill time like “Who’s new and who isn’t?” Spotting either was fairly simple. The former bunch bears dazed glances and open mouths. A person gyrating through the mob with minimum physical contact had been practising for the Local Train Olympics for a few years at least. When it was my turn to head back to the suburbs, I warmed up, adopted a stance that would make Usain Bolt proud and dashed off like the Flash into an incoming train. Like millions of others, Bombay taught me independent travel, in the crudest sense of the term. And it prepared me for the swirling madness that lies in the rest of India.\n",

      "\n",
      "For my money, memorable disagreements often centre on food. A friend who was about to settle abroad was feeling particularly wistful about a storied south Bombay restaurant, the kind of eatery that locals like to call “overrated” and guidebook-toting tourists faithfully make a beeline for. His favourite on the menu? The baklava—a dry fruit-laden traditional sweet that smacked of decadence in every bite.\n",
      "\n",
      "The first time he requested for the dessert at the restaurant, its eccentric owner was not impressed. Sizing up his credentials, he asked, “Have you had baklava before?” “Yes.” “Where?” “In Turkey.” Suspicions confirmed, the gentleman chided him. “Arre baba, that is the Turkish baklava. This is the Iranian one…” What followed was a 10-minute tutorial on the precise ways in which they differed, part-comical and part-endearing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Forget the grand battles for identity being waged around the world, food drives everyday culture wars. They are infinitely more interesting and the only injury caused is to one’s pride—we could all use some schooling on that front. Besides, unlike spikier tiffs, these usually end in smiles and a knowing wink.\n",
      "\n",
      "Last year I was perusing dinner options at Le Goutillon, an unpretentious French bistro in the heart of Chantilly. After four days in the country, most of my companions were satisfied with their fill of meat and wine, and chose conservatively. However, I and another compatriot were feeling emboldened (perhaps, it was the glass of red) and scanned the chalkboard menu for more adventurous fare. “Bring us the steak!” we declared.\n",
      "\n",
      "When our substantial cuts of beef arrived, it was soon revealed that we had held our appetite in unwarranted esteem. At the end of that meal, Goutillon’s server—a stern, no-nonsense woman—took an eyebrow-cocked look at our barely empty dishes and shook her head in disapproval. A local hotel manager later reminded us of our misplaced bravado. “Oh yeah, I heard about the Indians who didn’t finish their steak!” he giggled. France 2; India 0.\n",

      "In 2008, the comedy Bienvenue chez les Ch’tis gave France’s north the image boost it had long been craving. There is a famous scene in the movie where the protagonist is summoned by his superior, who is about to deliver grave news. “Fired?” guesses the hero. “No, worse,” comes the reply. “Transferred.” When our hero finds out that he is to be positioned somewhere up north, he is mortified.\n",

      "\n",
      "The region, officially known as the Hauts-de-France, has been unfairly characterised by many in France as unsophisticated.

      "Isabelle mutters, “I loved the old church, the beautiful church. Not this thing on the outside.” Construction on the cathedral began in 1854, but it was halted after the two world wars. Finally, in 1999, the incongruous front was hurriedly erected.\n",

      "\n",
      "Golf is obviously the sport du jour in any resort town; in Le Touquet, horse riding and bicycling remain popular too but the sport that fascinates this town is sand yachting. Simply put, the activity involves reclining inside a yacht on three wheels, and manoeuvring it on the beach with the help of sails.\n",
      "\n",
      "My group of five travellers is about to get a first-hand immersion in the sport. We head to the Centre Nautique de la Manche Bertrand Lambert, where our painfully amateur attempts are monitored by instructor Jean Bernard Bacquet. Jean is hawk-eyed and brusque, barking directions at us—“You will all fix your own sails without any help.” So we do just that, lift our yachts and position ourselves inside it lying down and holding tight to the rope attached to our sails. Bacquet sets us off, but steering the yacht in a straight line as the wind bears down on us is a daunting prospect.\n",
      "\n",
      "More than once, my yacht loses steam, swerves like a car losing control and crashes into the waves. Then, on the third or fourth attempt, with a little nudge from Jean, my sail gains momentum and I glide forward. It’s a minor victory but my loud whoop decidedly proves it meant far more.\n",

      "“You won’t have time to see the cathedral fully even if you stay here all day,” warns Julia, hinting at the sheer scale of its architecture.

Julia is right—the cathedral demands hours of study.\n",

Within minutes, the white moussey concoction is polished off.\n",

Then, the knife-twist. A guide handed Happy a smartphone. “Wasn’t this T2?” he asked, as we stared at the photo of a tiger blankly. Happy, outsmarted once, was not to be outdone again. “No,” he assured the man. “I think it was one of the new male tigers.”\n",

      "Kanha Earth Lodge was all wood and warmth; Pench had a lighter, modern touch. A total of six airy and spacious lofts, raised on Mahua trees, the whole place revelled in its rough edges—grass blades poked and prodded at you, as you walked along its narrow pathways that led to the treehouses.\n",

      "“I am feeling the pressure,” said Chinmay Deshpande, the man who was to be our guide for the next few days. Word of our misfortune with tiger spotting had reached Pench and now, Chinmay, studious and assured, was determined to strike gold.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alone in my treehouse, I walked onto the deck and surveyed the view—40 acres of dry wilderness. Each of the six treehouses were at a significant distance from each other. So I only had the immediate company of my avian neighbours to look forward to. In the daytime, nature’s seclusion felt more welcome than wary.\n",
      "\n",
      "Night was a different matter. We were warned to never step out of our treehouse without a flashlight; any impromptu solitary adventures were discouraged. “There can be snakes here sometimes,” Harish Arya, lodge manager revealed, casually waving out to the woods.\n",
      "\n",
      "During our walk at dusk though, there was no unexpected slithering to be heard. Chinmay was keener on spiders, shining his light on a geometric web, woven by an orb spider, caught between two twigs. He stuck his forefinger into the web, “Look how it sticks in the centre but seems to be invisible as it expands towards the edges,” he whispered in admiration. “This is how they catch their prey.”\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "Back at the pool and dining centre, Chinmay doled out more food for thought with a slide show about Pench’s main attractions—prime among them, a legendary tigress called Collarwaali. “She is quite bold and doesn’t care if tourists are around or not,” he offered. She wouldn’t mind us then.\n",
      "\n",
      "Through dinner, as we wolfed down chef Pankaj Fulera’s eclectic fusion menu (makai ki khees, chicken ravioli, beetroot halwa), the conversation remained tiger-focussed. “Pench is a dry and deciduous park,” Chinmay noted. “There’s more room here for tigers to cohabit without getting into conflicts with each other. Unlike Bandhavgarh, where the density of tigers has risen to the point that the cats are competing with each other for territory.”\n",

      "Both Kanha and Pench are tiger reserves but there is a lot more to see here, from the sambar (top left), which can be spied ambling all over the parks, to the Indian scops owl (top right), spotted roosting on trees, jackals (bottom right) and the ubiquitous long-tailed shrike (bottom left). Photos by Riddhi Parekh.\n",
      "\n",
      "For nearly the first three hours of our safari drive next morning, the park seemed unusually silent. Chinmay tailed a few paw marks along mud-strewn trails, snapping his head every time he heard a “call”—signs given out by other animals of a predator in sight.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was 11 a.m. An hour to go before the drive wrapped up. We were settling down for breakfast at Pench’s famous Alikatta square when the Gypsy in front of us revved up and drove off. A knowing glance passed between the guides of both vehicles.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Quick, we have to go,” Chinmay said. Steering his vehicle as fast he could, he rammed us straight into a long dusty lane with lantana outgrowth on both sides. We were late. Ahead, a stream of 4x4s were backed up, one after the other, tourists standing up on the backseats and drivers’ seats looking to one side. “Woh rahi,” one of them shouted. Chinmay stood up, gestured to us, “Look, you see her… Collarwaali?” Unfussed by the hoopla, the tigress had crossed the road, her striped behind disappearing into the bushes.\n",

      "Champagne: France’s Bottom’s Up Approach\n",
      "\n",
      "I check my smartphone for the time—11.40 a.m.—before my attention wheels back to the pressing matter at hand: drinking champagne. Six flutes of the finest white wine from Champagne Pannier, a prestigious house in the scenic Marne Valley of France, have been placed in a shapely cluster on a white tabletop. Standing on one side of that table, in an understated white-walled tasting corner in Pannier’s head office in Chateau-Thierry, Eve Masselaert, the brand’s guest relation manager, is setting the stage for the bubbly.\n",
      "\n",
      "She tells my group of five travellers, all of us on a four-day visit to northern France, “This champagne is best had before breakfast… before you even eat anything.” Mildly surprised looks are exchanged. It is nearly time for brunch and I muse silently, “Champagne in the morning is my cup of tea indeed.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The tasting is a coda to our 45-minute tour of Pannier House and its historic underground cellars, limestone quarries dating back to the 12th century that were built to facilitate local construction. In 1937, the son of Louise Eugene Pannier, to whom the Pannier line of champagne started in 1899 is originally credited, purchased these quarries and used them to store and age sparkling wine.\n",
      "\n",
      "Pannier’s cellars hold around four million bottles in different stages of assembling and maturation. Photo courtesy: Northern France Tourism-HRB\n",
      "\n",
      "We had set out earlier in a minivan from the quaint tourist town of Chantilly to Chateau-Thierry, a community in the Champagne province, the drive more than agreeable with sun-kissed vineyards stretching on both sides of the road. Champagne (the wine-growing region in France spread over 34,000 hectares) is ground zero for sparkling wine producers, thanks to its high moisture-retaining terroir—a perfect storm of climate and topography necessary for a good yield. Houses of international repute (Moët & Chandon and Veuve Clicquot among others) are based in the cities of Reims and Epernay, both less than an hour away from Chateau-Thierry.\n",
      "\n",
      "Pannier, one of the suppliers to the French president’s residence—Élysée Palace, has built a niche reputation among connoisseurs, primarily because the house ages its cuvées (the technical term for a type of champagne blend) longer than big-named brands. I had expected Pannier house to be the epitome of ostentation, everything that champagne signifies, but my first impression of the reception area is that of a deliberately muted sophistication. White walls and white flooring, with an unfussy desk and an advertising standee in one corner—the place looked less like the gilded age, more like corporate minimalism.\n",
      "\n",
      "Soon Masselaert arrives to take us through the cellars that lay beyond the main entrance in the lobby. Because the temperature in the caves is more champagne-friendly: 12°C, jackets have to stay on, she instructs. Wearing a black shawl, she leads the way. We fall behind her, first crossing a modest display area of bottles of Pannier in varying sizes, and then entering a labyrinthine underground passage.\n",
      "\n",
      "The rock-walled cellars snake wildly, their jagged surfaces ravaged by time. Every few minutes we encounter racks of dark bottles, carrying wine of different varieties, neatly stacked next to each other. Pannier’s expansive cellars are spread over two kilometres but the tour only covers 300 metres of it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Striding through the dimly lit caves, I reckon it could have served as an apt setting for a swashbuckling Indiana Jones-style adventure or a medieval drama full of intrigue. Real life has come close. “During WWI, the cellars provided refuge to French soldiers and local families from the German invasion,” says Laure Renaud, Pannier’s wine tourism and marketing manager, in an email exchange I have with her after my visit.\n",
      "\n",
      "Chateau-Thierry’s vineyards are known for a high concentration of Pinot Meunier grapes. Photo Courtesy: Northern France Tourism-Vincent Colin\n",
      "\n",
      "There is no drama in the process of creating champagne though, a drink that can propel the wildest, most hedonistic celebratory instincts in the best of us. Quite the opposite, it is a precise and serious art. Masselaert’s words at the tour’s start indicate as much. “There are three main conditions for the ageing and storage of champagne—humidity, darkness and temperature,” she says.\n",
      "\n",
      "Controlling all three generates optimum conditions for the wines to blend. To those uninitiated in oenology, champagne-making can seem complex and long drawn. Our tour includes two different video presentations—one detailing the region’s history with champagne and the other breaking down the steps of making champagne. Broadly, the latter involves blending permutations of three wine varietals—Pinot Noir, Pinot Meunier and Chardonnay. After the initial fermentation, a cuvée of different wines undergoes a second fermentation in a sealed bottle, with yeast and sugar added incrementally. This produces the crucial carbon dioxide needed for the bubbles.\n",
      "\n",
      "Half-way through our visit, Masselaert acquaints us with jargon like “reserve wine”—high-quality wine that is stored for several years and used to blend with wines of younger vintage—and “riddling”—wherein the corked bottles are arranged upside down on A-frames (wooden racks shaped like the alphabet). The inverted bottles are rotated intermittently and aged for a minimum of three years.\n",
      "\n",
      "The venue also hosts dinners and celebrations for special occasions. Photo courtesy: Northern France Tourism-HRB\n",
      "\n",
      "Masselaert’s crash course in champagne production lasts around 30 minutes. At the tasting, she uncorks a white wine champagne from the brand’s prized brut selection. The first hit of the chardonnay packs in a sublime and elegant acidity.There are no performative “oohs” and “aahs” from the group; instead everyone appears to be taking a moment to fully grasp its aftertaste. Needless to say, the drink is top-notch. Masselaert then unveils a rosé with a more fruity, wholesome effect. The white is more to my taste; so after a sip or two of the pink, I reach for it again.\n",
      "\n",
      "In her matter-of-fact mien, Masselaert offers a word to the wise, the next time any of us find ourselves in a room with champagne. “Watch where the bubbles come from,” she says. “If it’s from the bottom of the glass, it’s excellent champagne. If it’s not, then… it’s not good champagne.” And I, for one, am grateful to her for that “bubbly” truth.\n",
      "\n",
      "Visitors can take direct flights to Paris from Indian metro cities. Champagne Pannier’s cellars are located in Chateau-Thierry, which is about 96 km/75 min from Paris. A visit along with a tasting costs €12/Rs915. You can also taste two different champagnes (€18/Rs1,381) or three (€24/Rs1,841). The tours are conducted in French and English. At the end of it, visitors are free to make a purchase from their house selection.\n",

      "Life in a Paris Metro\n",
      "\n",
      "A few days before my brief stay in Paris this September, I was lurking online amongst the good people of the internet, as you do anytime you want your productivity to hit sub-zero levels, when I chanced upon a reddit communiqué. It was an extended rant, which the internet claims proficiency in. “So you’re going to take the metro in Paris this summer,” said the author before launching into a list of around 20 dos and don’ts for the inexperienced visitor.\n",
      "\n",
      "The tips were pithy, useful and couched in exasperated irony. On personal hygiene: “Take a shower, god dammit. If the train is crowded I could end up closer to your body than your girlfriend.” On how to behave: “If you’re not sure whether you’re in the way or not, you’re in the way.” On being lost: “You can ask a Parisian for help but please start with a ‘bonjour.’ We will feel bad about your accent and feel obliged to help you.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Bless the writer’s heart because each time I scurried down the stairs of a train station in the French capital subsequently, those words rang true. My hotel, near the Place de la République square, stood right next to the entry point to République, a stop that served four metro lines. For three days, this was my central command centre to navigate the city.\n",
      "\n",
      "Under République’s white-tiled, brightly lit dome, I would perch myself on a Motte seat (one among different styles of seating architecture in subway stops across Paris) and make my mental calculations, staring at a map of crisscrossing coloured lines. “Switch over from the purple to the pink line. Wait, which one’s the yellow line again? Change three different lines? Hell, no!”\n",
      "\n",
      "In the subterranean world, Paris shed some of its polished sheen. Mass transportation has a way of doing that to even the most advanced of cities. Rats skipped jauntily across tracks, the homeless made themselves at home in corners and, come nightfall, public urination was the right of mischief-makers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Not that there weren’t signs of elegance and artistry. At Châtelet, a violinist’s mournful rendition of “Habanera” from Carmen almost made me miss my train. The word search mural at Concorde, designed by Francoise Schein to spell out the Declaration of the Rights of Man from the French Revolution, was as much of a time sink. I could have gazed admiringly for hours at Place des Abbesses’s art nouveau iron-and-glass awning on the entrance. But that would have meant climbing the station’s winding staircase—a feat as gruelling as a Stairmaster workout.\n",
      "\n",
      "Within a span of three to four journeys, the metro had become my safe space. Franz Kafka famously observed, “The metro is the best way for foreigners to imagine they’ve a quick, correct grasp of the essence of Paris.” The key, of course, is that it is “imagined”—an illusory feeling of belonging that travel lulls a person into.\n",
      "\n",
      "At museums, public squares and historic monuments, being the rootless flaneur can feel reassuring. Everyone in these places is from somewhere else. In restaurants and cafés, if you stood out as the other, you could argue that the newness was the whole point.\n",
      "\n",
      "But in the underground rail system, a refuge of workaday men and women, clueless tourists are an intrusion. Perhaps it’s the result of living in Mumbai, a city full of high-strung commuters, that has made me sensitive to this fragile temperament.\n",
      "\n",
      "So every time I stepped into a train in Paris, the reddit commandments scrolled silently in my mind. My attempt was to be nonchalant and unobtrusive, give the distinct impression that I have been jumping into and out of these metallic grey coaches forever.\n",
      "\n",
      "On one Saturday evening, I had to amend my plans en route to Saint-German following a sudden shower. Sprinting out to the nearest metro stop, I arrived at the ticket gate and forgot a crucial commandment: “Searching for your ticket right in front of the gate is NOT OK.” Eventually, I fished out my ticket from my drenched satchel butafter I had borne the full consternation of my fellow passengers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Obviously I had some distance to go before perfecting the Parisian metro etiquette. To the redditor who had so painstakingly tried, I can only submit a sincere “pardonnez-moi.”\n",

      "\n",
      "Shey Bhumi is the kind of place that sends the “panorama” feature on smartphones into overdrive. To be fair, that could also double as an accurate general assessment of Ladakh’s beaten-down and barren magnificence, which seems to evoke inexhaustible astonishment from any vantage point. Shey, in particular though, is unlike many of the other stay options available in Leh, Ladakh’s focal city nestled in the Himalayas. Most hotels or guest houses here are located in and around the central shopping square, and as is wont in so many hinterland towns of India, they strive for urbanity. I, however, was headed to an escape removed from all the hubbub.\n",

      "The communal dining space at Shey Bhumi. Photo Courtesy: Kaya Dorje\n",
      "\n",
      "From the airport, it took nearly 30 minutes for my pick-up to drive past the property’s unfussy iron gates on a narrow road in the tiny hamlet of Chuchot-Yokma. My arrival here had coincided with truant weather. It was supposed to be summertime in Leh—usually a vibrant visual palette of crystal-blue skies and icy peaks bleeding into a landscape of dusty brown slopes and willowy plains. But as I scampered out of my vehicle, I met my worst fear: the steady drizzle of rain and the lashing force of the wind.\n",
      "\n",
      "Shey’s manager Rupesh Sawant, a cheery and gregarious host, was at hand to greet me. Without missing a beat, he glanced up at the skies and chided, “Looks like you brought the Mumbai monsoon with you.” I did not have time to register my disappointment or my surroundings. I was quickly ushered up the steps to the terrace of a traditional Ladakhi structure. Sawant ducked his head to enter a small wooden door and I stepped in behind him.\n",
      "\n",
      "The place I found myself in, located centrally in the property, was once the ruin of an old Ladakhi home, as per Sawant’s recounting. Now restored, it served as Shey’s communal dining area with a kitchen downstairs. I took in some of the newer decorative touches, like the bright red wooden columns hand-painted by local monks and the comfortable floor-seating flanked by antique dining tables. They were adequate as adornments without diminishing from the house’s ancient provenance.\n",
      "\n",
      "Cosy rooms are done up using traditional Tibetan and Ladakhi furniture. Photo Courtesy: Kaya Dorje\n",
      "\n",
      "Breakfast wrapped up, I then made my way to my private cottage, a little farther from the dining hall. Standing in the doorway of what would be my home for the next two days,Shey Bhumi finally came into sharp focus. I was struck by how nature had been allowed to take its own course here with bare minimum interference, even for a property that advertises its rustic bona fides.\n",
      "\n",
      "The six-acre property included 10 cottages, in the local folk mode of a white-stoned square facade with a flat roof, lined with red beams on its borders. As opposed to a manicured landscape neatly designed for a postcard, each cottage was separated by wild grass and uneven bushes of sea buckthorn. Through the grassy outgrowth, there were makeshift wooden paths to each cottage, lined with lanterns intermittently.\n",
      "\n",
      "Inside the cottages, wooden floors, vintage chests, spacious beds with dragon motifs and carvings, subtly reinforced the theme of elegant outback comfort. Still, I imagine what visitors must come to SheyBhumi for was the money shot: a stunning and expansive view of the mountains, which flanked the retreat on all sides. My private cottage opened out to the Zanskar range while from the dining hall, you could spot the Ladakh range. To my dismay, a gloomy, grey filter had been pulled over both these scenes.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was only a day and a half later that I got my photo finish. Sawant had asked me to look out for a trifecta of colours—the azure blue sky, punctuated with snow-capped tips, and muddy tan slopes, sometimes with a hint of purple. Walking out onto my front porch, there it was: the multi-coloured swatch that had eluded me so far. Panorama shot, check.\n",
      "\n",
      "From atop the dining hall terrace, you can spy Thiksay Monastery. Photo by: ~Usergi15632539/Istock\n",
      "\n",
      "There is, of course, more to Shey Bhumi than mountain-gazing. Intermittent rain had played spoiler on my itinerary with the entry by road from Leh to Nubra Valley and Pangon Lake blocked. But I gleaned some cultural enrichment, devoting an entire day to Ladakh’s famed monasteries—Hemis, Thiksay and Spituk—all at a 20-30 minute ride from the property.\n",
      "\n",
      "In retrospect, I am glad because the seclusion only heightened Shey’s faraway appeal. I remember chancing upon Ancient Futures, a treatise on the Ladakhi people by Helena Norberg-Hodge, in the dining hall book collection. Norberg-Hodge celebrated the resilience of Ladakhi people, hoping that the modern life didn’t edge out a simple culture that cherished contentment. During my visit, everything had not gone as I had wanted but in the end, I was certain I left contented.\n",

      "There are moments when the therapeutic benefits of travel can hit home harder than any of the dispassionate advice received on a shrink’s couch. Displacement, in a strictly physical sense, clarifies both mind and body. For Kalki Koechlin, that breakthrough came during a trip to Karuna Farm, a nature retreat near Kodaikanal.\n",
      "\n",
      "Although she can’t quite trace the timeline—it was two-three years ago, she says—the circumstances that accelerated her existential crisis are still vivid. “I was in a state of transition with my divorce and a lot of changes in my personal life,” recalls the actor, alluding to her 2015 parting with filmmaker Anurag Kashyap. “Other things were happening at the time too like illnesses in my family and financial pressures.”\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "By the end of her journey, Koechlin had arrived at “practical solutions” to many of her problems. If this flash of satori, Zen-speak for enlightenment, has a Kerouac-ian ring to it, that’s because stripped of her glamorous facade, the 33-year-old exudes the air of a happy beatnik.\n",

      "It happens when I am saturated creatively. I can’t read. I can’t concentrate or even learn my lines. When it gets to that, I know I need to travel. It’s kind of like emptying the cup so that you can fill it up again. Before, I used to work like a headless chicken for a year-and-a-half and then suddenly feel like I am a failure.

Travel was a way of life for him, like it was for many people in the 1960s and ’70s. He used to make paragliders, hand gliders and small aircrafts. So my childhood was filled with, you know, jumping off cliffs in a hand glider from the top of the mountain. And then a little later on, I was the one who had to drop him to the top of the mountain in a car and drive down by myself.\n",
      "\n",
      "With my parents, I remember some distinct trips. One was to the Himalayas. That was the first time I ever saw snow. I think I was eight or nine. We used to do a lot of treks in and around Mudumalai near Ooty, where I went to school. Then when I was older, I made my first trip to France to visit my grandparents. They lived near the Vosges Mountains in eastern France and there I learnt to ski. So yeah, I had a country bumpkin upbringing of sorts.\n",

We were both these young boho wanderers in love, going everywhere by train. We had just read Herman Hesse’s Siddhartha and would write poetry together.

Two years ago, I accidentally ended up on a solo trip to Sicily. On the short flight there I made friends with this troupe of classical musicians. They were amazing. They took me to their concerts. Then from there, I went to some of the smaller beach towns near Sicily.\n",

It’s about jumping on the bandwagon of whatever’s going on that week. There’s always someone who connects you to something else. And you find your way.

After a while, I was with his family—there were about 20 of them—with a grand matriarch sitting on a table. Somebody was playing the piano and there was all this food.

      "In all of this, you are just reminded of life and humanity. You realise that life exists outside your own bubble. And that it’s not the same but it’s equally difficult. People may think that just because someone lives in the mountains they must be so happy but that’s not the case, they have their own struggles. Travel is never about escapism for me.\n",

      "Speaking of the mountains, what do you like about them?\n",
      "\n",
      "Once a year, I try to go to the mountains… Kashmir, the Himalayas, the Northeast or in the south. It’s about the quietude and the vast expanse. My favourite place are the mountains near Karuna Farm, a place I find the spiritual. Whenever I am in the mountains, I am more meditative. If I am there long enough, I start writing. I also like going to Pondicherry to isolate myself and study my scripts closely.\n",

      "What was the most significant trip of your life?\n",

      "It was the visit to Karuna Farm I mentioned earlier. I was in a vulnerable place physically and mentally. At the farm, my friend and I met a guy named Hart, who was an out-and-out hippie, living in a thatched hut and everything. We ended up spending a lot of time with him. He went through a whole bunch of healing experiences with me. I returned to Mumbai with a clear idea of what I needed to do.\n",
      "\n",
      "Going to the mountains might have seemed like I was escaping but at the time, through all the conversations and experiences I had had, I came back with most of the solutions. That was when I decided that from here on, I would travel when I was saturated. It’s like that Buddhist tale about the turtle who yearns to be a dragon.

      "Airbnb India’s Country Manager Amanpreet Bajaj on Making the World Home\n",
      "\n",
      "Amanpreet Bajaj is by all accounts a busy man, whose job entails taking a flight out to somewhere in this world at least once a month, but he is loath to consider himself a typical business traveller. Instead the India country manager of Airbnb, the online rental platform that has reinvented how people travel since 2008, prefers the new-age concept of “bleisure”. The explanation is self-evident: business trips that also afford some of the joys of unencumbered travel.\n",
      "\n",
      "In a conversation over the phone from his office in Delhi, 36-year-old Bajaj reveals that he had been travelling for work long before Airbnb. “I was lucky because I was a consultant (with Ernst & Young, India) early in my career. Part of that role involved constantly going to a different country to learn. The friends I made when I was in those places ensured that I was made to feel at home,” he says.\n",
      "\n",
      "In his consulting days, Bajaj would spend at least three to four weeks in a foreign location. “I worked through the week and then weekends were spent exploring whichever city or town I was in,” he says. That meant anything from spending hours roaming around Paris to dropping by the best restaurant in Amsterdam or checking out the latest hotspot in New York.\n",
      "\n",
      "Greece is a perennial favourite of Bajaj’s.Photo Courtesy: Amanpreet Bajaj\n",
      "\n",
      "Wanderlust runs in Bajaj’s family. His father owned a transportation business and any downtime was spent taking road trips, often through north India as they drove to meet relatives in Delhi. “My father was the kind of person who wouldn’t just drive from one location to another. He would stop at roadside dhabas, enjoy the sights and love to start a conversation with people. He encouraged me to do the same,” remembers Bajaj.\n",
      "\n",
      "It’s an ethos he has carried through to his dealings today. Thanks to travel, he has also picked up hobbies he never would have considered. Sailing is a fledgling interest. “I wouldn’t have ever considered sailing in India. I experienced it for the first time in Greece and because I had such a wonderful time, I now sail whenever I go there. I find someone who has a boat and we go to one of the islands nearby,” he says.\n",
      "\n",
      "Greece, sunny and postcard perfect, is a perennial favourite with Bajaj. Its genial hospitality and familial culture appeal to his Indian roots. “Greece is like another home to me. Everywhere you look, there are remnants of the country’s ancient history and civilisation. The people are warm and value family ties. And, the cuisine is delightful,” he says. In Athens, Bajaj’s usual stomping grounds are the local flea markets, in and around the city centre, or Brettos, one of the city’s well-known bars. “Brettos is the oldest distillery in Athens that serves ouzo (a traditional Greek aperitif), high quality brandy, and more than 36 different flavours of liqueur, many of which are not available in other establishments,” he reveals.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bajaj’s idea of fulfilling travel isn’t extreme, either in luxury or adventure. He prefers down-to-earth interactions with new faces instead. “Travel is a good way to realise that whatever apprehensions a person might have before he or she goes somewhere, the people they meet are probably thinking the same way. So that presents a great opportunity for cultural exchange and finding common ground,” he says.\n",
      "\n",
      "Switzerland is another favourite destination of Bajaj’s. “The whole country is so picturesque and the people are highly disciplined,” he says. Photo by Boris Stroujko/Shutterstock.\n",
      "\n",
      "Home or how to make people feel at home is a constant motif in his responses perhaps because Airbnb’s equity with travellers around the world depends on it. In November 2015, that skill faced its greatest test after a series of terrorist attacks shook Paris. Bajaj was there that night dining at Flora, along with some Airbnb hosts who were in town for an annual company event.\n",
      "\n",
      "“As soon as the news broke, we went to our Airbnb listing which belonged to a Frenchman,” he remembers. “We spent almost one-and-a-half days in his home trying to locate every employee and making sure they were safe. We couldn’t step outside but the French host was so kind. He called us to let us know that there was enough food in the fridge to last us during our stay there.”\n",
      "\n",
      "For Bajaj, that was a life-affirming moment and, according to him, it’s what travelling comes down to—forming real and authentic connections with strangers. And there’s no substitute for that. “I know that there’s talk these days of Virtual Reality (VR) replacing travel one day but all that will remain a novelty. As long as we are human, we will want to go to a place and feel it in our bones,” he says.\n",

      "Taste Trumps Travel…\n",
      "\n",
      "All of us take cues from our families on how to be or, in many instances, how not to be. When it came to food, I took from mine an open-minded appetite since much of mi familia was found wanting on that front. Anything new or foreign was viewed with wariness, at best, and derision, at worst. So I determined to try my damndest, like Seinfeld’s George Costanza, to do the opposite.\n",
      "\n",
      "In my pre-teens, there was a moment when this contrast came into focus. It was the 1990s; a simpler time when the average Indian palate was tentatively opening up to global influences. The occasion was a relative’s wedding reception with one of those multi-cuisine buffet spreads—mostly Indian and Indianised Chinese.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sometime during the proceedings, a dear uncle of mine (I might have to reconsider that “dear” after this revelation) marched to the buffet line and surveyed his options. A native of Kerala, he had lived in the state all his life and was authoritative, opinionated and possessed of a provincial mind-set, especially in matters of eating.\n",
      "\n",
      "At a counter that said Chinese chilly chicken, he stopped. I watched as he served himself a portion and stuck a forkful into his mouth. His head began to shake slowly and his eyes grew wider. Just like a music video playing in reverse, the fork went back in and out came the sampling.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What the hell is that?” he barked at the server standing behind the counter. The poor man smiled meekly and blurted, “It’s Chinese, sir.” “Well, no wonder it’s terrible,” my uncle shot back. With that sweeping generalisation, he had condemned this alien cuisine as unworthy of his respect.\n",
      "\n",
      "Needless to say, my uncle never did travel to China or, if I am assuming right, even felt compelled to visit a country whose food had produced such a violent reaction in him in the first place.\n",
      "\n",
      "I dredge this history up because at some point in their sojourns, foodies might confront a conundrum: would they travel to a place with a cuisine they don’t care for? A good friend is not the biggest admirer of Kashmiri food or typical Rajasthani fare. Dal baati churma? “Overrated,” she says. Ditto the legendary Kashmiri kahwa. But neither fact will dissuade her from going back to these places, in a heartbeat.\n",
      "\n",
      "I recall another friend, who had a short-lived romance with a dreamy Scot and the dreamier landscape of his country, during whic, she had to fake enthusiasm for Scotland’s famously disagreeable national dish—the haggis (a savoury pudding made of meat, onions, spices and oatmeal and cooked in a sheep’s stomach). Bland Scottish food, however, dimmed in comparison to the beauty of ancient castles and her knight in shining armour.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is significant where your first brush with a new cuisine occurs. In India, anything international is often diluted by fanciful contemporary trends or gauche local touches. And that early impression may leave some indisposed to a particular kind of food. Or worse, if you never try the real thing, you may forever live in blissful oblivion of what you are missing out.\n",
      "\n",
      "A few years ago, an acquaintance at whose home I had enjoyed many an Italian meal, travelled to Naples. Upon her return, I found that her white sauce-drenched penne, slathered in cheese, had changed. Her sauce was now a blanched tomato reduction, with only a hint of herbs, and plain olive oil. Over lunch, she then declared what a novice she had been all along, saying, “Things are done so simply in Italy. Indian continental places are the worst.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The proliferation of international cuisine restaurants has understandably fuelled a horde of poor parodies, which are not the greatest gateway into authenticity. A recent trip to Pattaya altered another pal’s view of the Tom Yum Soup that was served back home. “I haven’t ordered it at all since I returned from the trip,” she told me.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some of you, who are quite content with the native Tom Yum, may judge people like her to be purists but that is a natural side-effect of travelling extensively. The traveller’s heart hankers after genuine experiences. Cuisines will disappoint and delight in equal measure. It’s wandering into the unknown that is the real thrill.\n",

      "Leaning out from a bridge leading into Wat Rong Khun, I squint at a stucco moat of outstretched hands and grisly skeletons. Two massive horns arch over the walkway, while a few steps ahead, giant statues of Death and Rahu guard the entrance, like burly bouncers poised to restrict my entry into heaven. “The bridge of rebirth,” I overhear a foreign couple talking. A swampland of desire—enslaved arms—lie in wait blocking a mortal’s road to nirvana. This was rebirth as an infernal spectre, not Elton John’s PG-13 “Circle of Life.”\n",

      "Chiang Rai’s White Temple could stand in for a gonzo Disney dream, a lakeside monument studded with fragmented mirrors blinking from every inch. Artist Chalermchai Kositpipat, its eccentric creator, draws heavily from manic surrealism. He also loves allegory. White signifies the Buddha’s purity; glass denotes his luminosity. The bridge opens into a vast main complex, a safe space for souls free of want. Besides the usual aspects of a shrine, I saunter past some oddball touches—replicas of Iron Man, ghouls hanging from trees and a golden lavatory.\n",
      "\n",
      "Inside the temple’s principal hall, Kositpipat’s unleashes his freakish vision to the hilt in imposing Buddhist murals, spiked with late 1990s/early 2000s mainstream culture and fired through a space cannon. My eyes scan cosmic battles, the Twin Towers aflame, Neo from The Matrix, Elvis Presley, Michael Jackson and the notorious big Bs (Bush and Bin Laden). It’s symbolism in overdrive. Not far from here the souvenir shop hawks these mural scenes on smaller prints. I make a beeline for it. Seeking a want, you might rightly deduce. My soul shrugs as the bridge beckons.\n",

      "It’s before dawn at Horizon Village & Resort, in the rural outskirts of Chiang Mai’s Doi Saket district, and I am biding my time with Supriya, a photographer and my travelling partner on this trip. We sip tea in near silence on the lawn out front. A crew of staffers pump two deflated hot-air balloons, burners spewing fire into their openings. Our pilot, clad in a blue T-shirt, sizes up his passengers. Pointing at me, he implies that lightweights will go last. Behind him I catch the other balloon lifting off, so we pile awkwardly into our basket. Within minutes, Thai Captain Kirk steers us off. As he tinkers with the burner, he reminds us, “Depending on the wind, we can go high or stay low.” We play it safe for nearly 15 minutes. My fingers are tracing the outlines below, a tranquil garden of rice field squares but just when I have a lay of the land, our commander accelerates and the ground blurs beneath my feet. Our goal is to witness the sun’s earliest rays light up the sky’s Rothko blues, which it does in a flashy few seconds. Back on earth, we return to the resort, where we are toasted like Formula One drivers. Instead of trophies, we receive certificates. Bemusement is writ large on our faces, when Captain Kirk, holding an uncorked bottle of bubbly in one hand, signals. I step forward. Bend your head, he says. I follow, waiting for champagne to rain on me. The drink hits my hair like an icy trickle washing down this morning’s warm glow.\n",

      "While the Bangkok Grand Palace is all glittering pagodas and coiffed greens, at Bhubing Palace, the royal family’s holiday estate, old-fashioned cottages peek out from hilly stilts, embraced by acres of lovely gardens. Anutree, our spry Chiang Mai guide, had chalked out half a day for our exploration. She kicks it off with a light trek to the Doi Suthep, a mountain in western Chiang Mai, a wonderful vantage point to enjoy the province’s lush wonder. After the exertion, Bhubing Palace is a breeze, ideal for a lazy reverie along rose and orchid-sprouting pathways. From Bhubing, we ride upwards again to Doi Pui tribal village; a refuge of the ethnic community Hmong. Anutree guides us into a the living quarters of an elderly Hmong woman, dressed in a hemp skirt, with rough silver hair bundled up in an knot. It’s a tiny thatched-roof hut with dirt flooring and no doors or rooms for any purpose. Utensils are piled in a corner, in a rubble, along with discarded wood. Anutree tries to make conversation with the lady but she simply stares as though we are from a faraway planet. Later at the tribal market where some Hmong villagers sell their handicrafts, I walk out with a pair of hemp boots, unable to shake that withered face with pale grey eyes from my memory.\n",

But my journey till now had included its fair share of gold-rimmed temple trails. So I am restless for a not-that-quaint experience. MAIIAM Museum of Contemporary Art in San Kampheang promises to be an outlier. At first though, my senses scramble at the museum’s low-key simplicity; lately they’ve been attuned to florid classical architecture. I enter a plain, long rectangular warehouse, its facade overhauled with rippling glass tiles, refracting playfully in the sun. Inside, Spartan gallery units house a permanent display and temporary exhibits on two floors. MAIIAM owes its repository to a family of private collectors with a taste for contemporary Thai works. Fortuitously, the art on its walls today alludes to timely subjects—migration, identity and exile.\n",

This is the work of Sawangwongse Yawnghwe, a Burmese artist originally from Myanmar’s Shan state, also battered by a bloody past.

When we arrive at Khum Khantoke, inside a business park in Chiang Mai city, much of the ground seating circling the performance arena is already taken by hives of tourists and large family groups. Once the servers arrive bearing food, the steady hum of their incessant chatter subsides. Khantoke in Thai translates to a small dining tray with tinier bowls of food in it. Not at all difficult for an Indian to grasp—imagine a thali with the best of northern Thailand’s specialities. I can count eight bowls in my khantoke and, in one of them, the spicy chilli paste our guide had raved about earlier. The paste is to be eaten with steamed veggies but really, it can also be used as a side with the khantoke’s other dishes—minced pork in tomato sauce, dark red pork curry (also, Anutwree’s recommendation), banana fritters, sticky rice, fried rice noodles and crispy pork skin. Chowing down mouthfuls of pork crunch and chilli paste, I admire a bevy of women in gilded crowns swaying gracefully to classical Thai numbers. A slew of cultural variety acts follow, from dramatic war dances to mythical retellings. Even though riveted, minus any context, I am somewhat befuddled.

      "Usually, I am not one to sign up for arduous outdoorsy plans if I can help it but hiking in Doi Inthanon National Park, home to Thailand’s tallest mountain at 2,565 feet, feels like a light refreshing sprint. Our guide is a chatty local man in khakhis wielding a tall wooden stick that he keeps occasionally tapping against trees and rocks, as if to scare away lurking spirits. “Majority of people here with Karen tribe,” he reveals in his broken accent. Members of the tribe farm for their sustenance and throughout the hike, our guide points out to terraced rice fields, coffee plantations and strawberry fields. We aren’t the only hikers this morning; groups of birders and backpackers squirm past us along narrow rocky climbs. Waterfalls interrupt the forest scenery from time to time and after we rest by one such gushing cascade, we tread back to the start and part with our hiking guide. Anutree says she knows a great lunch spot and so, we set off for Doi Inthanon Royal Project, which is a farming research endeavour patronised by Thailand’s royal family. “The royal project is a source of income for the tribes,” Anutree tells us, while shepherding us in and out of agricultural glasshouses with all kinds of produce growing inside them. And it is this bounty that is used to cook all the dishes at the Royal Project Kitchen, where we settle in for a meal. From our table, I take in the scenic panorama of Doi Inthanon stretched out below. That view alone is worth the price of admission, I concur.\n",

I am about 10-12 kilometres from Belmond Napasai’s lush tropical resort in Koh Samui, my home for the last day-and-a-half, and the sun is blindingly bright overhead. This is ideal snorkelling weather; we have had a field day gasping at eels and corals underwater. But the heat has stymied chatter on our boat.\n",

      "However, the aquamen on board won’t have any lull. Blasting dance numbers from the speakers, Pumpui swivels his hips throughout the ride, Shakira-style, exhorting us to join in. We muster a few, muted rhythmic claps. Sometimes he pulls faces through a snorkel mask and, in another instant, casually hangs from outside the boat window like an impertinent daredevil. When Pumpui tires, he steers the boat and Poo takes over as cheerleader. I crack a bemused smile at their relentlessly sunny Laurel & Hardy routine. Perhaps every resort should have a slapstick comedy pairing on hand to liven up spirits.\n",

This is the best view in the house, with the water’s emerald green depths glinting at my eye, breeze rifling through open white tents on the lit-up beachfront below and tall balletic palm trees in the distance watching over the darkness.

That night, my travel group meets the resort’s general manager, Jeroen Nettekoven, for an elaborate dinner at Lal Thai Restaurant. As the staff rolls in a scrumptious spread of spring rolls, satays and salads, Jeroen helpfully decodes what’s in front of us. I can’t get enough of the southern-style lamb gravy in shallots, peanuts and dark sauce and the sautéed morning glory, all served with fragrant, light rice, for the main course.

      "In Thailand, Nostalgia on Wheels\n",
      "\n",
      "As soon as a long, gleaming dark green train carriage, emblazoned with ‘Eastern & Oriental Express’ in engraved gold lettering slides into Hua Hin station, I feel a tinge of self-consciousness. Neither I nor my co-passengers from India are dressed for something this imperial. For the last hour, we have been milling about Hua Hin, Thailand’s oldest railway station—a quirky but fading royal artefact—in our baggy tees, jeans and dusty shoes, lugging backpacks and satchels. Once I hop aboard the train though, the air is less intimidating. While this is a majestic luxury locomotive boasting every accoutrement of refined sophistication, I see open, friendly faces in casual wear and summer hats.\n",
      "\n",
      "To be clear, our group is not actually travelling on the E&O Express, presently journeying between Singapore and Bangkok. We are only passing through, being shown around for a brief period by a senior manager in an impeccable grey suit. Launched in the 1990s, the Express’s carriages originally belonged to another train called the Silver Star, but they have now been refitted to reflect Indochina’s fine artistry and its Western past. We are in the train’s bar area, where both style elements compete for attention: the walls and flooring appear to evoke a colonial-era, upper-class gentlemen’s club with tanned teak wood panels. And then, there are more decorative finishes, which nod to Asian designs, from the train’s silken upholstery to its intricate marquetry on furnishings. Outside, Hua Hin’s landscape scrolls by, framed by windows, like a scene from a TV screen. The comfortable sofa-style seating is separated in the middle by a compact side table with an antique lamp. Reclining in one of the seats, I sense the appeal of spending a few hours catching a snooze with a half-read paperback resting on my lap.\n",
      "\n",
      "At local Thai train stations, the Eastern & Oriental Express attracts onlookers often hoping for that perfect selfie (top); The train’s jazzy bar (right), where cocktails have such names as Mist on the Rice Paddies, also hosts live music; Wood interiors inside the cabins (bottom) add to its throwback vibe.

      "\n",
      "Behind the bar counter, a spiffily attired bartender in a vest whips out a signature cocktail, presenting it with a smoke-filled grand finish for the cameras. The drink is there for our taking but there isn’t any time for tasting and we hurry on to the dining car for a meal cooked by the train’s chef Yannis Martineau. I dig into some duck that’s spiced in dark local sauces but retains the classic delicacy of French cooking; even dessert, usually a rich amalgam of milk, fruit and coconut in Thai meals, has a lightness to it.\n",
      "\n",
      "When passengers want to come up for air, they head to the Express’s observation car at its far end. En route, we pass a hallway of closed doors, our guide identifying them as sleeper cabins. For fans of Agatha Christie, the stuffy passage should jog a memory. After all, the Express was a backdrop for one of her most famous mysteries, finally unlocked by Hercule Poirot and his moustache twirl. Christie’s iconic work cemented the train as a world of slinky glamour, full of fashionable cloche-hatted beauties, imposing English dames and debonair playboys.\n",
      "\n",
      "The observation car is a beautiful wooden cabin with yellow lights on the ceiling. As we enter, it is busy. A well-heeled Chinese brood—grandparents, aunts, uncles and their young ones—has lined up against the main window to capture that elusive perfect family shot. Some guests are here for their post-lunch reverie. Some folks immediately can’t resist bringing out their cameras but most people appear glad to do nothing except watch the Express move through an unspoiled Thai countryside.\n",
      "\n",
      "It’s a prized view, all right, but is it worth a few thousand dollars? Aren’t there mountains to scale or planes to skydive out of for that kind of cash? I recall observing a tall blond American in the dining car on a table across the aisle, gently chatting with his grandfather, all shaky jowls and quivering fingers. The chef had stopped by their table to enquire, “Are you liking the food?” The old man, for whom speech had become an impediment, beamed a toothless smile that could light up the whole compartment. For his delighted grandson, that was a timeless payoff.\n",

      "\n",
      "The world’s greatest cities are brutal, unsentimental places, precisely the reason why so many of us fall so irrevocably under their spell. In its worst hour, this bond can curdle into bitter complaints of unrequited affection and everyday torment. “The subway doesn’t work, trash is overflowing and it’s too crowded; this is over.” Let me assure you that right now someone somewhere is uttering these words about your dream metropolis, New York, Rome, Rio De Janeiro. Like an unrepentant cad, the city laughs in their face, “Go on… live without me.” Wresting long-term connections comes with the occasional pang of nostalgic regret. Those who can’t escape their love of cities are destined to keep replaying that first flush of romance, that moment when a city went from a destination to home.\n",
      "\n",
      "A traveller’s sense of a city is always ephemeral. Not that this discredits his or her insights but to genuinely get under the skin of a modern metropolis, we look towards its people, leaning against its sidewalks, reading in café nooks or flirting in nightclubs. One of the best descriptions of city love I’ve read is in a wonderful book on London with a rather circuitous moniker: Londoners: The Days And Nights Of London Now—As Told By Those Who Love It, Hate It, Live It, Left It, And Long For It. In it writer Craig Taylor, who lived in the British capital for years, recalls relocating to Toronto and fielding that pesky question, “How do you feel about London?” He had a complicated answer, “It wasn’t a two-way relationship. It was no use thinking this place loses any sleep over me.”\n",
      "\n",
      "That’s the messy conundrum of a great city, as experienced by its besotted paramours, some of whom can’t kick the habit even if they tried. Travellers attempting to understand an urban jungle are better off trying to study its undercurrents. In September’s ode to five global cities, NGTI attempts to get a measure of their pulse. A writer dives into Belfast’s turbulent past to fully grasp its present-day vibrancy, another digs into the back alleys of Kuala Lumpur’s inimitable heritage food joints. We profile New York’s Hudson Yards, a gaudy spectacle that has divided New Yorkers, and chronicle the rise of Bauhaus in Tel Aviv. Finally we unpack Finland’s oldest city Turku.\n",
      "\n",
      "A city is fertile land for dramatic histories, new narratives and moving stories. Travellers, never immune to these irresistible tales, are bound to pass through its golden gates, over and over.\n",

      "The Great Outdoors May Not Be Great for Long\n",
      "\n",
      "Part of the allure of a remote place is that the closer we get to it, the more we risk everything that made it precious. For years, Mount Everest inspired a sense of forbidden majesty, which was surmounted only by a few courageous adventurers. It helped that they were entertaining and we were content to immerse ourselves in the stories they wove from these monumental expeditions.\n",
      "\n",
      "In 2019, life-changing experiences are more easily found. This is probably why, when a photo of tourists lined up outside Everest’s summit, as though it were some check-in counter at an airport dispensing visas, was widely debated three months ago, the overwhelming emotion was deflated acceptance. No one in this day and age will be denied their Edmund Hillary moment.\n",
      "\n",
      "In February, the New York Times ran a panicked headline about another solitary paradise, which had long been removed from sustained tourist interference—the Galápagos. “Going to the Galápagos Is Easier and Cheaper Than Ever. That Might Not Be a Good Thing,” it warned. According to the article, “in 2017, 2,41,800 people visited the islands, up from 1,73,419 a decade earlier.”\n",
      "\n",
      "I am not highlighting these concerns as a spoilsport to anyone’s dreams. Travellers have earned their right to be wherever they choose to be. Even more so, seeking out the elusive is neither new nor groundbreaking; people were born of this earthly garden and returning to its comforting delights is the most primal of escapes. But the irony of how long we have this profusion of wilderness has not been lost, especially while we look towards the outdoors for constant nourishment and inspiration.\n",
      "\n",
      "Despite the arguments in favour or against these developments, NGTI’s August edition remains an ode to bona fide outdoor enthusiasts, a sincere testament to how faraway mountains, hidden islands, sweeping canyons continue to wield a magnetic pull over us. We have packed this issue with epic journeys: a 10-day road trip from Iceland’s deep grey volcanic outback, a tropical joyride in Fiji, a playful encounter with wildlife in New Zealand and a first-time skier’s tentative venture onto the slopes of Tahoe.\n",
      "\n",
      "While enjoying these wonderful reads, try to think of that sagacious advice, often doled out when restlessness sneaks its dreary head—“Why not go outside?

      "Searching For Our Pop Culture Gods\n",
      "\n",
      "In this modern agnostic world, pop culture is the closest thing we have to a shared religion. Matinee idols, artists and rock stars are our gods and goddesses, feeding us an endless supply of enchanting lore and myths. For this movement to thrive though, it needs fans; followers who have gone beyond aloof observation. Pop culture requires that fans click below to subscribe, not let it just play in the background.\n",
      "\n",
      "One of my favourite explorations of fandom is Almost Famous, Cameron Crowe’s amusing semi-autobiographical movie about a wide-eyed teen writer and music geek, William, who receives the assignment of a lifetime when a magazine commissions him to join his beloved rock band on the road. William’s mentor is Lester Bangs, a senior critic with a hilarious zeal for mainstream culture. Lester would often launch into passionate defences of popular music, and a few lines from one fiery soliloquy, delivered to William in a diner, have always stayed with me. “The day it ceases to be dumb is the day it ceases to be real. Right? And then it will just become an Industry of Cool.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Pop culture is the industry of joy, I like to think. Its idols make our lives immeasurably more tolerable. We carry their songs in us, we live inside the fables they create. Sometimes, we travel to be reminded of them. Or other times, they recreate the places for us. Children of the nineties probably bought into two exaggerated but equally popular versions of New York, depending on what they watched—Friends or Seinfeld. If you grew up glued to the former, you thought the Big Apple was a city full of broke singletons who spent endless hours in coffee shops, cracking wise. If it was the other, your New York was a place with impatient eccentrics out to steal your soup recipe.\n",
      "\n",
      "In NGTI’s seventh anniversary edition, pop culture is the dominant conversation—travelling to relive the stories of famous movie stars, musicians, chefs and authors, to seek out their influences in the places they loved, from Colombia to Vietnam. Our contributors have handpicked their deities—Anthony Bourdain, Don Draper, The Beatles, Harry Potter, Shah Rukh Khan, among 18 names. We are true believers in these men, women and characters. Travelling in their shadow feels wonderful, delirious and appropriate. If this issue comes off as an unapologetic love fest, that’s entirely accurate. As Lester would put it, we are righteously dumb and hopelessly uncool.\n",

      "A Bombay Classic That Endures\n",
      "\n",
      "New and exciting has always received top billing in food—the latest fad, the newest restaurant, the trendiest neighbourhood, the healthiest diet. Often, these developments are accompanied by breathless pundit-like pronouncements: Lebanese is the new Chinese; Chinese is new Italian (wait, where does leave that Italian then?) A cuisine or dish has a moment, peaks and then becomes passé.\n",
      "\n",
      "While there is no shortage of cover versions, originals stand the test of time. And at National Geographic Traveller India, we confess to being partial to one classic. Creating and editing magazines in this day and age, with limited or, sometimes, binding resources, is a mental endurance test. Nothing makes the looming pressures more palatable than food. It is always on our mind. What gets us through the final sweaty hours, month after month, is an absolute Bombay fixture—the vada pav. We are a group of ardent foodies, and the deadline-hour vada pav toast is our modest tradition. Vada pavs are to Mumbai what hot dogs are to New York. Naysayers can knock the street staple all they want but we, at the magazine, are quite misty-eyed about our Bombaiya tastes.\n",
      "\n",
      "And for our collective money, there is no vada pav that quite matches Ashok Vada Pav, or the Kirti College vada pav, as it is casually referred to. The choice might feel obvious to insiders but it is well deserved. Vada pavs are simple—stick a fried potato ball with a sweet scintillating chutney in a fluffy bun; what can go wrong? But Ashok Vada Pav punches up with the zingiest combination of sauces and just the right cook on the vada, and tops it off with the showstopper—crispy fried crumbs of batter. Think of it as vada pav with fries.\n",
      "\n",
      "My thoughts on the vada pav can get more mawkish and graphic but suffice it to say that the pleasures of food are timeless. All the features in this month’s edition, from Pondicherry, Los Angeles, all over Europe, Laos and New Zealand, recall this essential aspect of travel. Regular readers can pick up any edition of our magazine and confirm our dedication to food. Our writers go to wondrous locations and more often than not, they return with stories of food, of how a single bite opened a fascinating world to them. Once a year, we devote our energy into creating a singular edition where ‘good food’ is not the sideshow of journeys. For that special issue, taste doesn’t seem incidental to storytelling, the spotlight follows it everywhere it goes.\n",

      "Redefining #Goals\n",
      "\n",
      "Once-in-a-lifetime is an overused expression in travel. Like everything else, the phrase has succumbed to a culture of instant hype. When every mountain hike, underwater dive or local meal is described with the glowing praise that should be meant for only the rarest of occurrences, it is difficult to tell a wonderful experience from a bucket list one. A bucket list just doesn’t translate with the same impact it was originally intended for.\n",
      "\n",
      "Why not reclaim the bucket list from this ordinariness? Travel goals, or at least the ones we file away under impossible, are defined by their incredulity. I would even go so far to suggest that if you don’t get laughed out of the room for your travel bucket list, you are doing something wrong. If it’s birthed in your imagination, why the restraint?\n",
      "\n",
      "A bucket list must elicit deep, almost-defeatist sighs or faraway looks. The appropriate response to photos of Arctic glaciers or Patagonian hikes is a sharp catch in your breath. It’s a recognition that as out of reach as a place seems, nothing can stop you from dreaming about getting there. It is poor little Charlie Bucket yearning that one day a strange man would welcome him into his outlandish chocolate factory.\n",
      "\n",
      "I empathise with Charlie because my earliest bucket list ideas were fictional too. As a kid, Tintin’s life of adventurous sleuthing across the globe seemed precious enough to envy. Adolescence was often spent in the thrall of Ray Bradbury’s stories from Mars. Adulthood, however, came with approachable aspirations and a Martian colony escapade was relegated to the fantastic realm. As time passes, bucket lists acquire a sort of silliness, like love letters from our past do, and many of us are content to keep them locked away, deep in our heart’s vaults.\n",
      "\n",
      "This month’s edition will hopefully dust the cobwebs off your bucket lists. If you have been lucky enough to tick off your dream destinations, then it may throw up new suggestions to start working towards. Either way, our compilation of 21 Journeys of a Lifetime does not take the word “lifetime” lightly. Sports fans can look forward to our guide to exploring England and Wales at the height of this year’s Cricket World Cup. Our treasure-island narrative from Fiji brims with enchantment, while more sophisticated types can dine off our drool-worthy dispatch from Dubai’s most extravagant hotel.\n",

      "Why Our Forests Need Watching\n",
      "\n",
      "J R.R. Tolkien was right to portray the Ents, hulking pieces of tall barks with sad eyes and mossy facial hair who guarded forests, as perhaps the most stoic figures in his Lord of the Rings trilogy. Their whole manner spoke to an endurance that seemed constantly on the verge of dissipation. They had seen and tolerated far too much in a world at war with itself. Yet they remained calm, like a steady lighthouse in torrential downpour.\n",
      "\n",
      "Treebeard, the oldest of these Ents, makes one of the wisest observations about Middle Earth and, if any of us think about it today, our Earth too. “I am not altogether on anybody’s side because nobody is altogether on my side…Nobody cares for the woods as I care for them.” I imagine his weary resignation is shared by this great planet’s animals and birds, especially its wild inhabitants.\n",
      "\n",
      "I’ll confess I have never been completely at ease in the jungle. I have enjoyed my few visits to national parks and sanctuaries but at the end of them, I have come away feeling like an intruder at a party, where no one approves of my appearance.\n",
      "\n",
      "But I do recognise that being in the wild is something everyone should attempt at least once in their lives. Notice how travellers on a forest safari often start unwittingly mimicking animal behaviour. They adopt stealthy stances behind thickets, sharply snap their necks about at the slightest indication of any movement or stand alert as if awaiting some imaginary clarion call. All this for a fleeting glimpse of a creature, who is either startled or unsettled by their presence. Animals are levellers; if we want to see them, it’s only fair we play by their rules.\n",
      "\n",
      "Chasing a wild animal also never succumbs to a pattern. Each time the excitement is unique, the story entirely unscripted and the heart, pounding and fully alive. Now, given what we know about the existential threats facing wildlife in the future, that experience is bound to be poignant too.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our wildlife special is packed with a slew of adventurous escapades from the woods, like two enthusiasts trailing the reclusive snow leopard in Ladakh and a writer looking back on the refreshing, quiet and unexpected thrills of Jim Corbett National Park. Some narratives shine light on getaways in crowded urban crawls such as wildlife hotspots in London. Others discover that forgotten tribes in India’s central parts are its finest sentinels. So yes, wildlife deserves to be seen thriving in its natural habitat. Go tiger-spotting, deer chasing or birding. As Treebeard said, the woods need all the watchers it can get.\n",

      "A Soulmate for Summer\n",
      "\n",
      "Every summer, the pastoral call of their motherland, Kerala, beckoned my parents. Their children would plead that they change direction at least for one year but these entreaties were dismissed as flakiness. Summer months were set in stone. And contrary to the breezy, game-for-anything attitude that the sun induced in many folks, for my mother and father, it was a season for constancy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kids, however, are enamoured of the new and for that reason my face developed a serious case of the ‘summer scowl’ for our family’s month-long sojourn away from the city. I held on to it as if it were my most precious accessory. Even in the midst of unbridled fun—summer in Kerala has a disarming way of wearing down the staunchest defences and a person can only sulk so much—I was quick to plaster the scowl back on. Any sign that I was enjoying myself would only encourage my parents’ loyalist tendencies, I figured.\n",
      "\n",
      "These days, my summers are as free as they can be. With providence and resources on my side, I could just as well spin the globe and pick a spot to summer at. But in the last few years, I have been searching for a tradition of my own making. Granted, the season is an exciting time of possibilities and a cue to throw caution to the wind. The unbearably same-old, same-old is made slightly not so, if only through temporary escape. As some of you would suggest, there’s no need to stay rooted in summer.\n",
      "\n",
      "Why this quest for a ritualistic journey to one place then? As light and frothy as summer is made out to be, it has long been associated with routines. Caucasians descending on Bali for their annual surf-and-yoga retreat, millennials on a camping trip to the Western Ghats, elderly couples heading to Mussoorie for a respite from the heat or die-hard road warriors planning their yearly summit to the mountains are all creatures of seasonal habit. Everyone has their go-to destination and it’s one where they try to create an idyllic alternate universe.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some of our readers may already have their summers planned. I imagine there are those, who will be following paths they have tread before. For others, NGTI’s summer issue has much to choose from—a scrumptious gelato-sampling feast in Italy, a charming rustic getaway on a Ratnagiri farm, an immersive trip to the holy land in Jerusalem and an artsy trail of Monet’s favourite haunts in Normandy, France. Perhaps, by the end of this summer, we would have found a place to call our own, a refuge to return to over and over.\n",

      "How Deep Is Your Travel Love?\n",
      "\n",
      "If there is a phrase I would prefer to retire from online bios, personal or professional, it is, “I love travel.” Or some approximation of that sentiment. To clarify, I am not against travellers or those who proudly flaunt their passion for travel. On the contrary, editing a travel magazine has now made me oddly protective of travellers and their ilk. My submission is that “love to travel,” suggested so casually, just doesn’t feel adequate to the depth of emotion it sparks in true devotees.\n",
      "\n",
      "In February, the month of love as endowed by our great gifting industrial complex, we are wrestling with what “love for travel” means in tangible, life-affecting terms. The early throes of discovering travel might not be too dissimilar to the beginnings of a feverish affair. A fleeting scene, sound or feeling that at first arouses, then enchants and eventually, lures us into a hypnotic state, evoking woolly-eyed reveries about what could be.\n",
      "\n",
      "This world, however, is not the most conducive for long-term passion, the kind that demands unflinching sustenance in the midst of distractions from a thousand notifications. Passion has many rivals to contend with. And in flippantly announcing travel as our first love, we are not fully considering the influence our other paramours (work, relationships or money) exert on us.\n",
      "\n",
      "Travellers for life are compulsive. They have to be; there is no other existence. Climate change, marriages, deaths, protests and politics might have to take a backseat. I am reminded of a wanderlust-happy couple that discovered chinks in their relationship during a road trip through Russia. The woman, upset and distraught, offered a solution: cut the trip short to come back home and rekindle their chemistry. The man, however, wouldn’t give up Siberia, despite a chance at a do-over. Please don’t go getting any ideas about breaking hearts but for some travellers, marital bliss too has its limits.\n",
      "\n",
      "In finding stories about travel as a lifetime affair, we looked for longevity. We chose accounts of love, which tempered by the prospect of actually living, may have assumed a subdued tenor. But it only took a remembrance or flicker to fan the ardour all over again. One budding artist writes of her admiration for Frida Kahlo, and a Frida-inspired pilgrimage to Mexico. One of our own staffers takes a mental journey back to the cities and countries that have bookmarked her blossoming long-distance affection while a mountaineer outlines why the solitude of the Himalayas will never fail to captivate her.\n",
      "\n",
      "Falling in love with travel is much like falling in love with a song. You wear it out until it makes you sick. But you have to be foolish and always full of song.\n",
      "\n",
      "Travel Inspiration for 2019 : A Book on Nietzsche and Hiking\n",
      "\n",
      "One of the finer books I read this year was John Kaag’s Hiking With Nietzsche, in which Kaag, a professor of philosophy, rekindles his passion for the German thinker while tracing picturesque hiking trails in the mountains of Switzerland. It’s a near-precise rendering of the travelogue as a self-help book. A young Kaag was an avowed Nietzsche acolyte but given the ravages of responsibilities and adulthood, the writer put his affinity to test by undertaking physically enduring hikes through the Alps, revisiting haunts that the philosopher escaped to, in search of solitude and salve. The journey’s demands, coupled with his own inner turmoil, are catnip for anybody feeling at cross purposes with their own life.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the book, Kaag quotes Neitzsche writing to his mother after he had spent time in Splügen, “I was overcome by the desire to remain here… this high alpine valley… There are pure, strong gusts of air, hills and boulders of all shapes… But what pleases me the most are the splendid highroads over which I walk for hours.” Travel as the answer to searching questions is hardly a radical idea but what’s endearing about the book is that it subtly confirms a basic tenet of why we go on these journeys in the first place. Sometimes, being on the move matters more than anything else. Meandering through his hikes with his wife and child, Kaag faces endangering moments. He doesn’t always accomplish what he set out to do. “Slipping” is as important as climbing, he insists, and he persists.\n",
      "\n",
      "Travel writing’s bogeyman, I have been told again and again, is the Internet. Information and narrative are in abundance from tourists traversing to parts of the world that were once inaccessible with frequency. Where to go, how to go there, and what to do once a person is there is now easily definable. And if more catastrophic visions of the future are to be believed, one day an algorithm will do it better than any of us.\n",
      "\n",
      "What must then a travelogue accomplish? Kaag’s book reminded me that it was to establish an intimate and immediate human connection to a place. This can never be rated highly enough. Travel is as much about geography as it is about people, in lands that don’t inhabit our minds as often. It’s an urgent hammer taken to the numbing solipsism and drudgery that modern living descends into. It is storytelling, which never gets old.\n",
      "\n",
      "As another year dawns, NGTI has an exhaustive compendium of places, beloved and obscure, from across India and the world that should find its way to any adventurer’s 2019 itinerary. Travel, for all its ubiquity, still has plenty of seduction left in it.\n",
      "\n",
      "What Dreams May Come\n",
      "\n",
      "Our year-end edition toasts ultra-indulgence while travelling, featuring itineraries that many will know to be out of their financial reach. In producing these narratives, I was struck by a contrast.\n",
      "\n",
      "Travel today is dominated by minimalists or downsizers, those who preach the gospel of “hard-knock wanderlust.” And they almost always reap universal admiration. They are characters to aspire to, examples of made-for-Instagram sayings such as, “All you need is a backpack” or “#MotorcycleDiaries.” Unable to join these gallivanting philosophers, others marvel at their brave rebellion—oh, to give up the predictability of overpriced tourist traps someday, they sigh.\n",
      "\n",
      "In this context, luxury travel evokes a Molotov cocktail of feelings. A billionaire on a sailboat hosting Jazz Age-style revelries in the French Riviera is inevitably setting himself up for mockery. The heiress, who flits off to shopping holidays in Milan and Dubai, might as well buy an extra pair of sunglasses for the shade directed her way. Extravagance passes muster if it panders to affordability. In the last few years, it has become intertwined with entitlement, a radioactive pejorative today.\n",
      "\n",
      "Upper-class travel doesn’t deserve this slight. As more astute aesthetes have reminded us in the past, refined tastes don’t have to be gauche. Living like royalty might have its privileges but it also spurs a temperament for beauty, grace and sensuality, which is why travellers will always fork out top penny for a night in Rajasthan’s many palace stays.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wealth facilitates the kind of understated exclusivity seen in the English countryside’s several castles or manors, once a venue for elegant ballroom dances. Luxury could also simply mean time well spent—or doing nothing—floating atop a sundeck in an unending stretch of the ocean.\n",
      "\n",
      "Professional travel writers are lucky to be granted access to these private paradises and, in December’s magazine, a handful of them have returned with colourful dispatches. One writer enjoys a happy recreational bubble in the Maldives, another is privy to up close views of big game in Botswana. There is also a roundup of New York’s elite food and drinking haunts, and coverage of the maiden cruise between Mumbai and Goa. All these retreats promise a hedonistic binge: grand feasts of fine wine and champagne, and views hidden from the typical trails.\n",

      "\n",
      "The great outdoors, around which our November edition pivots, is a deceptive catch-all, as such phrases tend to be. In day-to-day conversations, anything from after-school camping trips to sailing in the waters of Papua New Guinea risks being lumped in the same breath. But whoever put their mind to the term was no doubt thinking of great with a capital G. They were dreaming of outdoors that offer as much dislocation as possible. Where snow peaks rise out of clouds and canyons plunge the recesses of the earth.\n",

      "Geoff Dyer, one of travel journalism’s finest exponents, calls this a “sense of elsewhere.” Writing of an aunt, who sent him postcards from the southwest of America when he was in school, he recalls, “Hilda sent me brochures from places like the Painted Desert, the Petrified Forest and Monument Valley. These were landscapes I had glimpsed in Westerns, but the fact that someone I knew had been to them—had proved that they were real—gave me my first real sense of elsewhere.”\n",

      "My elsewhere memory from childhood doesn’t conjure anywhere near the same eloquence but it was just as resonant. One of my father’s favourite films was David Lean’s Lawrence of Arabia, perhaps a result of spending over a decade in the Middle East. He often sent long letters from his travels and, in one of them, he mentioned setting eyes on the desert for the first time, and feeling as if he was having his own T. E. Lawrence moment.\n",
      "\n",
      "Years later, watching the classic was an equally transporting experience. Each time, Lean’s camera dissolved from close-ups of Peter O’Toole’s mysteriously phlegmatic Lawrence to the sunlit sand dunes, bleeding out of the 70mm screen as it were, the impact was transcendent. For me, the desert was as elementally stark as outdoors got, Martian in its unfamiliarity and removed from all modern signifiers of life.\n",

      "\n",
      "Summer is a charming flirt. Easy-going and casual. Summer doesn’t huff and puff to win our affections. It has us at “Hello.” Winter broods like the tortured protagonist of big fat Russian novel. It is daunting and dramatic, burning with a slow intensity.\n",
      "\n",
      "The season’s reputation precedes itself, and often, not in a good way. It has a way of whittling down everything to its bare bones. Even relationships not attuned to its ebbs and flows can fray. At a dinner conversation I once attended, I listened in bemusement as a recent divorcee made the case that it was the Scandinavian frost that had cooled his ex-wife’s ardour. How original.\n",
      "\n",
      "Winter travel is an exercise in negotiation, especially for sunshine souls. “How many extra clothes do I have to pack now?” “The weather is minus-what-did-you-say?” All valid concerns but the recommendations far outweigh them. Take one trivial scoring point: the winter wardrobe, which is tres chic, and can make the most sartorially challenged among us look like runway models.\n",
      "\n",
      "The allure of winter lies in nature—so immense, overwhelming and, of course, achingly beautiful. In his collection of letters to an unborn daughter, Norwegian Karl Ove Knausgård meditates on the sounds of the season. “The screech of a crow, for instance, which in summer is just one note in a greater tapestry of sound, is in winter allowed to fill the air alone, and every single nuance in its rasping, hoarse, seemingly consonant-filled caws stands out.” Winter’s silences are missives from a distant world, electric and profound.\n",
      "\n",
      "Solitary revelations aside, winter can match summer for convivial fun. Think of Yuletide. Is there a more exuberant time of the year? To me, it’s the greatest incentive to plan a December trip to the west. To experience Christmas in its festive splendour, in all the clichés from postcards and fairy-tales.\n",

      "In the mid-2000s, I had the first of my several brushes with unemployment. This was no well-considered sabbatical. Instead it was a surprise shove that came out of nowhere. Losing a job is crushing but even more so if you are the only one. In the company of a few colleagues though, your shoulders droop less and the gloom takes on a lightheaded spin. You cloak despair in disdain, adopting a “What, me worry?” face. And then, you blot the world, and travel.\n",
      "\n",
      "So I accompanied one of my friends back to her hometown, Guwahati, where I was to join her mum and dad on a road journey to Shillong, and if the weather held steady, onward to Cherrapunji. The choice of Cherrapunji puzzled me initially for as far as I could tell, it was that place where it rained constantly. There were enough clouds hanging over me, I thought to myself.\n",
      "\n",
      "But since my arrival, my friend’s father, who is no more, had been keen on us travelling by road. He was a looming presence, with a fondness for fine booze and house parties. I remember that trip now in snatches—Guwahati (quiet and hilly), Shillong (cool long before cool was invented), homemade khao suey, bootleg liquor shacks along the border between Assam and Meghalaya, and a worn-out CD of Vivaldi in the car.\n",
      "\n",
      "The overwhelming memory I have though is of the Shillong-Guwahati highway, where locals peered out of tin-roofed houses and roadside shops hid culinary delights I had never encountered. And my host, stepping on the gas as if his modest SUV were an Italian speed monster. Driving unfettered always unleashed his inner outlaw, my friend would recall later. For a young me, he held an invigorating promise: Old age was fun and wild provided there were more road trips.\n",
      "\n",
      "Often, the way the world travels now—take a flight and run down a list of experiences—feels as if we are settling for watching trailers instead of entire movies. Road trips fill the gaps in places you think you know.\n",

Some, featured in this issue, are familiar, like a bike ride through the outskirts of Barcelona, a family holiday in Australia and a jaunt through ancient Greece.

      "I like a bit of pow-wow in any place. Let me rephrase before you think I am eternally hankering for a fight. What I mean is I would choose crooked streets over straight highways, sweaty mayhem over pristine elegance. This is why no matter where I go in this world, coming home to India, and especially Bombay, is never dull. I blame growing up in the city for my pugilistic predilections. One of the many descriptors that Mark Twain used in relation to Bombay was “pow-wow.” The place seemed to confound him: “Bewitching”, “Bewildering”, “Enchanting”, “Arabian Nights come again?”—the man was repulsed and riveted at the same time. It was a place befitting the number of exclamations he used.\n",
      "\n",
      "At 13, I was yet to be permitted the pleasures of travelling unchaperoned outside Bombay but within its confines, I had free rein to indulge my inner flâneur. I became the weekend loafer, slacking through parts of the city I really had no business being in. My itinerary hardly ever changed: Take the BEST bus to Chowpatty; after filling up on chaat, sample some more at the khau gully in Churchgate; sometimes, pretend to shop for music I could not afford at Kala Ghoda’s Rhythm House, where the desperately-trying-to-be-hip hung out in the 1990s. The final stretch was always my favourite: trudging along to my personal Shangri-La, Victoria Terminus.\n",

      "At VT, I parsed the sea of faces. I drummed up mind games to fill time like “Who’s new and who isn’t?” Spotting either was fairly simple. The former bunch bears dazed glances and open mouths. A person gyrating through the mob with minimum physical contact had been practising for the Local Train Olympics for a few years at least. When it was my turn to head back to the suburbs, I warmed up, adopted a stance that would make Usain Bolt proud and dashed off like the Flash into an incoming train. Like millions of others, Bombay taught me independent travel, in the crudest sense of the term. And it prepared me for the swirling madness that lies in the rest of India.\n",

      "Anniversary editions have the feel of a graduation: a year of studious slogging (of which, truth be told, my team and I do very little) and madcap fun (which we only wish we could indulge in more) rounded off with a sense of achievement and lingering anxiety. There’s pride that National Geographic Traveller India has lived to see another day, and in today’s precarious media landscape, that should account for something. Then the gnawing question: did we get it right?\n",

      "When it comes to travel, is there a right or a wrong way to do it? Early this month, The New York Times unearthed Albert Einstein’s entries of his journeys around Asia and discovered a surprising side to the Nobel Prize winner. About his time in mainland China he wrote, “In the air there is a stench of never-ending manifold variety.” The people, he found, were “industrious, filthy, obtuse…” Travel often functions as a Rorschach test of biases.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some are acutely aware of this and spend their time making amends. Anthony Bourdain’s recent passing prompted glowing tributes from around the world to his open-minded exploration of parts and cultures unknown.

      "The “how” of travel is a matter of debate too. Dyed-in-the-wool snobs harp on about authenticity and immersing yourself in local culture.

      "\n",
      "For my money, memorable disagreements often centre on food. A friend who was about to settle abroad was feeling particularly wistful about a storied south Bombay restaurant, the kind of eatery that locals like to call “overrated” and guidebook-toting tourists faithfully make a beeline for. His favourite on the menu? The baklava—a dry fruit-laden traditional sweet that smacked of decadence in every bite.\n",
      "\n",
      "The first time he requested for the dessert at the restaurant, its eccentric owner was not impressed. Sizing up his credentials, he asked, “Have you had baklava before?” “Yes.” “Where?” “In Turkey.” Suspicions confirmed, the gentleman chided him. “Arre baba, that is the Turkish baklava. This is the Iranian one…” What followed was a 10-minute tutorial on the precise ways in which they differed, part-comical and part-endearing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Forget the grand battles for identity being waged around the world, food drives everyday culture wars. They are infinitely more interesting and the only injury caused is to one’s pride—we could all use some schooling on that front. Besides, unlike spikier tiffs, these usually end in smiles and a knowing wink.\n",
      "\n",
      "Last year I was perusing dinner options at Le Goutillon, an unpretentious French bistro in the heart of Chantilly. After four days in the country, most of my companions were satisfied with their fill of meat and wine, and chose conservatively. However, I and another compatriot were feeling emboldened (perhaps, it was the glass of red) and scanned the chalkboard menu for more adventurous fare. “Bring us the steak!” we declared.\n",
      "\n",
      "When our substantial cuts of beef arrived, it was soon revealed that we had held our appetite in unwarranted esteem. At the end of that meal, Goutillon’s server—a stern, no-nonsense woman—took an eyebrow-cocked look at our barely empty dishes and shook her head in disapproval. A local hotel manager later reminded us of our misplaced bravado. “Oh yeah, I heard about the Indians who didn’t finish their steak!” he giggled. France 2; India 0.\n",

      "\n",
      "In 2008, the comedy Bienvenue chez les Ch’tis gave France’s north the image boost it had long been craving. There is a famous scene in the movie where the protagonist is summoned by his superior, who is about to deliver grave news. “Fired?” guesses the hero. “No, worse,” comes the reply. “Transferred.” When our hero finds out that he is to be positioned somewhere up north, he is mortified.\n",

      "In conversations with newcomers to France’s north, locals often bring up the film. As one resident memorably told me, “First, ze hero is crying because he come to ze north. By ze end, he is crying again… but zis time, because he iz leaving.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The region, officially known as the Hauts-de-France, has been unfairly characterised by many in France as unsophisticated. But any proud northerner will assure you that this is only because it remains underappreciated. I spent four days across four towns—Lille, Le Touquet, Amiens and Chantilly—and returned with ample stories to tell.\n",

      "Isabelle mutters, “I loved the old church, the beautiful church. Not this thing on the outside.” Construction on the cathedral began in 1854, but it was halted after the two world wars. Finally, in 1999, the incongruous front was hurriedly erected.\n",

      "\n",
      "Golf is obviously the sport du jour in any resort town; in Le Touquet, horse riding and bicycling remain popular too but the sport that fascinates this town is sand yachting. Simply put, the activity involves reclining inside a yacht on three wheels, and manoeuvring it on the beach with the help of sails.\n",
      "\n",
      "My group of five travellers is about to get a first-hand immersion in the sport. We head to the Centre Nautique de la Manche Bertrand Lambert, where our painfully amateur attempts are monitored by instructor Jean Bernard Bacquet. Jean is hawk-eyed and brusque, barking directions at us—“You will all fix your own sails without any help.” So we do just that, lift our yachts and position ourselves inside it lying down and holding tight to the rope attached to our sails. Bacquet sets us off, but steering the yacht in a straight line as the wind bears down on us is a daunting prospect.\n",
      "\n",
      "More than once, my yacht loses steam, swerves like a car losing control and crashes into the waves. Then, on the third or fourth attempt, with a little nudge from Jean, my sail gains momentum and I glide forward. It’s a minor victory but my loud whoop decidedly proves it meant far more.\n",

Rustic cottages and colourful flower beds dot islands along the canals, with ducks and swans paddling along peacefully.\n",

Julia is right—the cathedral demands hours of study.\n",

      "Grande Singerie is a peculiar boudoir, even for a chateau that’s full of eccentric flourishes. Wall-to-wall murals dominate this ornate chamber inside Chateau de Chantilly, a 20,000-acre palace complex belonging to the Condé family, who were cousins of Louis XV and Louis XVI. Each piece of art here, by Christopher Huet, is an anthropomorphic representation of monkeys. They smoke, they eat, they are human.\n",
      "\n",
      "Chantilly’s heart is this spectacular chateau and its gardens, designed by André Le Nôtre, the landscapist of Versailles. Grande Singerie is one of many opulent chambers in the chateau. The latter also houses Musée Condé (the Condé Museum), which possesses an art collection only second to the Louvre in Paris. Any credit for the chateau’s survival should go to the Duke of Aumale, the last Prince of Condé, who inherited it and ensured it remained intact through wars and revolutions.\n",

      "\n",
      "As we take in Huet’s art, the museum guide—a stern lady wearing black—issues a terse warning, “Do not mistake these works for criticism.” Anybody reading classist allegory into these paintings, therefore, stand corrected. “This was the king’s cousin’s house, so no criticism here. Purely for fun.”\n",
      "\n",
      "True enough, why would any feature on Chantilly mock nobility? It still lives like it belongs to an imperial age. The chateau’s Great Stables conducts spectacular equestrian shows with riders performing in powdered wigs and regency frocks. At La Capitainerie, a fine-dining establishment inside the chateau, Olivier Malherbe from the castle’s management team regales my group with tales of royal carousels during the reign of Louis XVII. “The carousels were about the connection between the rider and his horse, and the demonstration of this through exercises,” he says.\n",
      "\n",
      "As we speak, La Capitainerie’s kitchen is getting ready to showcase a regional signature—the Chantilly cream, known for its smooth, light texture. “It is full of butter, so lot of fat, eh,” says Olivier, then quickly adds, “But let’s not dwell on that.” We nod our heads and dive in. Within minutes, the white moussey concoction is polished off.\n",
      "\n",
      "Olivier and his horse-riding instructor Delphine, a boisterous American transplant to Chantilly, later join us on a jaunt around the impeccable gardens. Driving in a golf cart, we skim past symmetrical flower beds, blissful water bodies, statues and lavish fountains. Nôtre’s work at Versailles is far more ostentatious, though Olivier believes the man reserved his best for Chantilly. “Versailles has a great palace but we have the better gardens.”\n",

      "Eye on the Tiger in Madhya Pradesh\n",
      "\n",
      "It had been a dismal evening for Harpreet “Happy” Dhillon. He veered his open-air green Gypsy to a halt outside a crowded ticketing window in Kanha National Park. Lanky, bearded and soft-spoken, he was a naturalist from the Kanha Earth Lodge, my home in Madhya Pradesh for three days. Happy had driven me and my companion—photographer Riddhi Parekh, on her maiden wildlife assignment—all across the park in search of a memorable tiger sighting.\n",
      "\n",
      "That evening, we had concluded our final drive in the Kisli Zone, where we had missed seeing a cat by seconds. Three days. Zero tigers. I was certain that Happy was kicking himself.\n",
      "\n",
      "As soon as we were out of one of the park’s two main entrances, a fellow guide yelled from across the ticket counter, “Happy, tune tiger dekha?” Happy smiled—the kind of tight smile that threatens to dissolve into a scowl—and shook his head. Then, the knife-twist. A guide handed Happy a smartphone. “Wasn’t this T2?” he asked, as we stared at the photo of a tiger blankly. Happy, outsmarted once, was not to be outdone again. “No,” he assured the man. “I think it was one of the new male tigers.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Before any further argument ensued, we sped off. Happy was, as Riddhi and I noted, perhaps quieter than usual on that ride.\n",

      "Any semblance of disappointment he felt was unfounded. Over three days, we had seen plenty to send us back chuffed: a lonely black buck grazing in the distance, jackals frolicking mid-siesta, a parade of barasingha antlers in motion.\n",
      "\n",
      "I had caught my breath a lot. Wintry morning drives across Kanha can do that to you. The park’s scenery changes dramatically. Swaying sal trees, quiet streams, muddy swamps, bamboo thickets—the landscape unfurls like nature’s own flipbook.\n",
      "\n",
      "My residence—the Kanha Earth Lodge, in the outer reaches of the park’s buffer zone—was so artfully conceived that I felt it was one with the greater ecosystem of the park. Comprising 12 luxury cottages, fashioned after local tribal architecture, the lodge evoked an outdoorsy western ranch in spirit, albeit with Indian aesthetics. The stone setting in the walls was asymmetrically precise, while the wood furniture inside and outside the 12 terracotta-roof cottages—sinewy and graceful.\n",
      "\n",
      "Covering 16 acres of land, the property included an organic garden, an infinity pool and a main cottage where guests trickled in to lounge by a huge fireplace. A central chandelier-lit hall in the cottage hosted lunch and dinner, typically rustic preparations such as the gond thali and laal saag.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kanha Earth Lodge had all the bells and whistles of a plush wildlife getaway but there was an emphasis on teaching guests about the forest. Evening entertainment—or edutainment—was usually a wildlife documentary, aired on a projector above the fireplace.\n",
      "\n",
      "Although summer is the best time for sightings at Kanha, mornings in winter can be stunningly picturesque. Photo by Riddhi Parekh.\n",
      "\n",
      "The lodge’s manager, Bharat Mandhyan, had been a naturalist for years, overseeing birding tours all across India. “At Kanha, you will have a wonderful time, yes. But hopefully, you will also learn something about wildlife,” he told me.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was our last night at the lodge and we were being treated to a bushfire dinner under the stars. Digging into kebabs, we laughed off our consecutively unsuccessful tiger chases. The next morning, we were to leave for Pench Tree Lodge, nearly three hours from Kanha along the route to Nagpur. “Let’s see if we have better luck in Pench,” my friend said.\n",

      "“I am feeling the pressure,” said Chinmay Deshpande, the man who was to be our guide for the next few days. Word of our misfortune with tiger spotting had reached Pench and now, Chinmay, studious and assured, was determined to strike gold.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alone in my treehouse, I walked onto the deck and surveyed the view—40 acres of dry wilderness. Each of the six treehouses were at a significant distance from each other. So I only had the immediate company of my avian neighbours to look forward to. In the daytime, nature’s seclusion felt more welcome than wary.\n",
      "\n",
      "Night was a different matter. We were warned to never step out of our treehouse without a flashlight; any impromptu solitary adventures were discouraged. “There can be snakes here sometimes,” Harish Arya, lodge manager revealed, casually waving out to the woods.\n",
      "\n",
      "During our walk at dusk though, there was no unexpected slithering to be heard. Chinmay was keener on spiders, shining his light on a geometric web, woven by an orb spider, caught between two twigs. He stuck his forefinger into the web, “Look how it sticks in the centre but seems to be invisible as it expands towards the edges,” he whispered in admiration. “This is how they catch their prey.”\n",
      "\n",
      " \n",
      "\n",
      "Back at the pool and dining centre, Chinmay doled out more food for thought with a slide show about Pench’s main attractions—prime among them, a legendary tigress called Collarwaali. “She is quite bold and doesn’t care if tourists are around or not,” he offered. She wouldn’t mind us then.\n",
      "\n",
      "Through dinner, as we wolfed down chef Pankaj Fulera’s eclectic fusion menu (makai ki khees, chicken ravioli, beetroot halwa), the conversation remained tiger-focussed. “Pench is a dry and deciduous park,” Chinmay noted. “There’s more room here for tigers to cohabit without getting into conflicts with each other. Unlike Bandhavgarh, where the density of tigers has risen to the point that the cats are competing with each other for territory.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Both Kanha and Pench are tiger reserves but there is a lot more to see here, from the sambar (top left), which can be spied ambling all over the parks, to the Indian scops owl (top right), spotted roosting on trees, jackals (bottom right) and the ubiquitous long-tailed shrike (bottom left). Photos by Riddhi Parekh.\n",
      "\n",
      "For nearly the first three hours of our safari drive next morning, the park seemed unusually silent. Chinmay tailed a few paw marks along mud-strewn trails, snapping his head every time he heard a “call”—signs given out by other animals of a predator in sight.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was 11 a.m. An hour to go before the drive wrapped up. We were settling down for breakfast at Pench’s famous Alikatta square when the Gypsy in front of us revved up and drove off. A knowing glance passed between the guides of both vehicles.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Quick, we have to go,” Chinmay said. Steering his vehicle as fast he could, he rammed us straight into a long dusty lane with lantana outgrowth on both sides. We were late. Ahead, a stream of 4x4s were backed up, one after the other, tourists standing up on the backseats and drivers’ seats looking to one side. “Woh rahi,” one of them shouted. Chinmay stood up, gestured to us, “Look, you see her… Collarwaali?” Unfussed by the hoopla, the tigress had crossed the road, her striped behind disappearing into the bushes.\n",
      "\n",

      "Champagne: France’s Bottom’s Up Approach\n",
      "\n",
      "I check my smartphone for the time—11.40 a.m.—before my attention wheels back to the pressing matter at hand: drinking champagne. Six flutes of the finest white wine from Champagne Pannier, a prestigious house in the scenic Marne Valley of France, have been placed in a shapely cluster on a white tabletop. Standing on one side of that table, in an understated white-walled tasting corner in Pannier’s head office in Chateau-Thierry, Eve Masselaert, the brand’s guest relation manager, is setting the stage for the bubbly.\n",
      "\n",
      "She tells my group of five travellers, all of us on a four-day visit to northern France, “This champagne is best had before breakfast… before you even eat anything.” Mildly surprised looks are exchanged. It is nearly time for brunch and I muse silently, “Champagne in the morning is my cup of tea indeed.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The tasting is a coda to our 45-minute tour of Pannier House and its historic underground cellars, limestone quarries dating back to the 12th century that were built to facilitate local construction. In 1937, the son of Louise Eugene Pannier, to whom the Pannier line of champagne started in 1899 is originally credited, purchased these quarries and used them to store and age sparkling wine.\n",
      "\n",
      "Pannier’s cellars hold around four million bottles in different stages of assembling and maturation. Photo courtesy: Northern France Tourism-HRB\n",
      "\n",
      "We had set out earlier in a minivan from the quaint tourist town of Chantilly to Chateau-Thierry, a community in the Champagne province, the drive more than agreeable with sun-kissed vineyards stretching on both sides of the road. Champagne (the wine-growing region in France spread over 34,000 hectares) is ground zero for sparkling wine producers, thanks to its high moisture-retaining terroir—a perfect storm of climate and topography necessary for a good yield. Houses of international repute (Moët & Chandon and Veuve Clicquot among others) are based in the cities of Reims and Epernay, both less than an hour away from Chateau-Thierry.\n",
      "\n",
      "Pannier, one of the suppliers to the French president’s residence—Élysée Palace, has built a niche reputation among connoisseurs, primarily because the house ages its cuvées (the technical term for a type of champagne blend) longer than big-named brands. I had expected Pannier house to be the epitome of ostentation, everything that champagne signifies, but my first impression of the reception area is that of a deliberately muted sophistication. White walls and white flooring, with an unfussy desk and an advertising standee in one corner—the place looked less like the gilded age, more like corporate minimalism.\n",
      "\n",
      "Soon Masselaert arrives to take us through the cellars that lay beyond the main entrance in the lobby. Because the temperature in the caves is more champagne-friendly: 12°C, jackets have to stay on, she instructs. Wearing a black shawl, she leads the way. We fall behind her, first crossing a modest display area of bottles of Pannier in varying sizes, and then entering a labyrinthine underground passage.\n",
      "\n",
      "The rock-walled cellars snake wildly, their jagged surfaces ravaged by time. Every few minutes we encounter racks of dark bottles, carrying wine of different varieties, neatly stacked next to each other. Pannier’s expansive cellars are spread over two kilometres but the tour only covers 300 metres of it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Striding through the dimly lit caves, I reckon it could have served as an apt setting for a swashbuckling Indiana Jones-style adventure or a medieval drama full of intrigue. Real life has come close. “During WWI, the cellars provided refuge to French soldiers and local families from the German invasion,” says Laure Renaud, Pannier’s wine tourism and marketing manager, in an email exchange I have with her after my visit.\n",
      "\n",
      "Chateau-Thierry’s vineyards are known for a high concentration of Pinot Meunier grapes. Photo Courtesy: Northern France Tourism-Vincent Colin\n",
      "\n",
      "There is no drama in the process of creating champagne though, a drink that can propel the wildest, most hedonistic celebratory instincts in the best of us. Quite the opposite, it is a precise and serious art. Masselaert’s words at the tour’s start indicate as much. “There are three main conditions for the ageing and storage of champagne—humidity, darkness and temperature,” she says.\n",
      "\n",
      "Controlling all three generates optimum conditions for the wines to blend. To those uninitiated in oenology, champagne-making can seem complex and long drawn. Our tour includes two different video presentations—one detailing the region’s history with champagne and the other breaking down the steps of making champagne. Broadly, the latter involves blending permutations of three wine varietals—Pinot Noir, Pinot Meunier and Chardonnay. After the initial fermentation, a cuvée of different wines undergoes a second fermentation in a sealed bottle, with yeast and sugar added incrementally. This produces the crucial carbon dioxide needed for the bubbles.\n",
      "\n",
      "Half-way through our visit, Masselaert acquaints us with jargon like “reserve wine”—high-quality wine that is stored for several years and used to blend with wines of younger vintage—and “riddling”—wherein the corked bottles are arranged upside down on A-frames (wooden racks shaped like the alphabet). The inverted bottles are rotated intermittently and aged for a minimum of three years.\n",
      "\n",
      "The venue also hosts dinners and celebrations for special occasions. Photo courtesy: Northern France Tourism-HRB\n",
      "\n",
      "Masselaert’s crash course in champagne production lasts around 30 minutes. At the tasting, she uncorks a white wine champagne from the brand’s prized brut selection. The first hit of the chardonnay packs in a sublime and elegant acidity.There are no performative “oohs” and “aahs” from the group; instead everyone appears to be taking a moment to fully grasp its aftertaste. Needless to say, the drink is top-notch. Masselaert then unveils a rosé with a more fruity, wholesome effect. The white is more to my taste; so after a sip or two of the pink, I reach for it again.\n",
      "\n",
      "In her matter-of-fact mien, Masselaert offers a word to the wise, the next time any of us find ourselves in a room with champagne. “Watch where the bubbles come from,” she says. “If it’s from the bottom of the glass, it’s excellent champagne. If it’s not, then… it’s not good champagne.” And I, for one, am grateful to her for that “bubbly” truth.\n",
      "\n",
      "Visitors can take direct flights to Paris from Indian metro cities. Champagne Pannier’s cellars are located in Chateau-Thierry, which is about 96 km/75 min from Paris. A visit along with a tasting costs €12/Rs915. You can also taste two different champagnes (€18/Rs1,381) or three (€24/Rs1,841). The tours are conducted in French and English. At the end of it, visitors are free to make a purchase from their house selection.\n",

      "Life in a Paris Metro\n",
      "\n",
      "A few days before my brief stay in Paris this September, I was lurking online amongst the good people of the internet, as you do anytime you want your productivity to hit sub-zero levels, when I chanced upon a reddit communiqué. It was an extended rant, which the internet claims proficiency in. “So you’re going to take the metro in Paris this summer,” said the author before launching into a list of around 20 dos and don’ts for the inexperienced visitor.\n",
      "\n",
      "The tips were pithy, useful and couched in exasperated irony. On personal hygiene: “Take a shower, god dammit. If the train is crowded I could end up closer to your body than your girlfriend.” On how to behave: “If you’re not sure whether you’re in the way or not, you’re in the way.” On being lost: “You can ask a Parisian for help but please start with a ‘bonjour.’ We will feel bad about your accent and feel obliged to help you.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Bless the writer’s heart because each time I scurried down the stairs of a train station in the French capital subsequently, those words rang true. My hotel, near the Place de la République square, stood right next to the entry point to République, a stop that served four metro lines. For three days, this was my central command centre to navigate the city.\n",
      "\n",
      "Under République’s white-tiled, brightly lit dome, I would perch myself on a Motte seat (one among different styles of seating architecture in subway stops across Paris) and make my mental calculations, staring at a map of crisscrossing coloured lines. “Switch over from the purple to the pink line. Wait, which one’s the yellow line again? Change three different lines? Hell, no!”\n",
      "\n",
      "In the subterranean world, Paris shed some of its polished sheen. Mass transportation has a way of doing that to even the most advanced of cities. Rats skipped jauntily across tracks, the homeless made themselves at home in corners and, come nightfall, public urination was the right of mischief-makers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Not that there weren’t signs of elegance and artistry. At Châtelet, a violinist’s mournful rendition of “Habanera” from Carmen almost made me miss my train. The word search mural at Concorde, designed by Francoise Schein to spell out the Declaration of the Rights of Man from the French Revolution, was as much of a time sink. I could have gazed admiringly for hours at Place des Abbesses’s art nouveau iron-and-glass awning on the entrance. But that would have meant climbing the station’s winding staircase—a feat as gruelling as a Stairmaster workout.\n",
      "\n",
      "Within a span of three to four journeys, the metro had become my safe space. Franz Kafka famously observed, “The metro is the best way for foreigners to imagine they’ve a quick, correct grasp of the essence of Paris.” The key, of course, is that it is “imagined”—an illusory feeling of belonging that travel lulls a person into.\n",
      "\n",
      "At museums, public squares and historic monuments, being the rootless flaneur can feel reassuring. Everyone in these places is from somewhere else. In restaurants and cafés, if you stood out as the other, you could argue that the newness was the whole point.\n",
      "\n",
      "But in the underground rail system, a refuge of workaday men and women, clueless tourists are an intrusion. Perhaps it’s the result of living in Mumbai, a city full of high-strung commuters, that has made me sensitive to this fragile temperament.\n",
      "\n",
      "So every time I stepped into a train in Paris, the reddit commandments scrolled silently in my mind. My attempt was to be nonchalant and unobtrusive, give the distinct impression that I have been jumping into and out of these metallic grey coaches forever.\n",
      "\n",
      "On one Saturday evening, I had to amend my plans en route to Saint-German following a sudden shower. Sprinting out to the nearest metro stop, I arrived at the ticket gate and forgot a crucial commandment: “Searching for your ticket right in front of the gate is NOT OK.” Eventually, I fished out my ticket from my drenched satchel butafter I had borne the full consternation of my fellow passengers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Obviously I had some distance to go before perfecting the Parisian metro etiquette. To the redditor who had so painstakingly tried, I can only submit a sincere “pardonnez-moi.”\n",

      "\n",
      "Shey Bhumi is the kind of place that sends the “panorama” feature on smartphones into overdrive. To be fair, that could also double as an accurate general assessment of Ladakh’s beaten-down and barren magnificence, which seems to evoke inexhaustible astonishment from any vantage point. Shey, in particular though, is unlike many of the other stay options available in Leh, Ladakh’s focal city nestled in the Himalayas. Most hotels or guest houses here are located in and around the central shopping square, and as is wont in so many hinterland towns of India, they strive for urbanity. I, however, was headed to an escape removed from all the hubbub.\n",
      "\n",
      "The communal dining space at Shey Bhumi. Photo Courtesy: Kaya Dorje\n",
      "\n",
      "From the airport, it took nearly 30 minutes for my pick-up to drive past the property’s unfussy iron gates on a narrow road in the tiny hamlet of Chuchot-Yokma. My arrival here had coincided with truant weather. It was supposed to be summertime in Leh—usually a vibrant visual palette of crystal-blue skies and icy peaks bleeding into a landscape of dusty brown slopes and willowy plains. But as I scampered out of my vehicle, I met my worst fear: the steady drizzle of rain and the lashing force of the wind.\n",
      "\n",
      "Shey’s manager Rupesh Sawant, a cheery and gregarious host, was at hand to greet me. Without missing a beat, he glanced up at the skies and chided, “Looks like you brought the Mumbai monsoon with you.” I did not have time to register my disappointment or my surroundings. I was quickly ushered up the steps to the terrace of a traditional Ladakhi structure. Sawant ducked his head to enter a small wooden door and I stepped in behind him.\n",
      "\n",
      "The place I found myself in, located centrally in the property, was once the ruin of an old Ladakhi home, as per Sawant’s recounting. Now restored, it served as Shey’s communal dining area with a kitchen downstairs. I took in some of the newer decorative touches, like the bright red wooden columns hand-painted by local monks and the comfortable floor-seating flanked by antique dining tables. They were adequate as adornments without diminishing from the house’s ancient provenance.\n",
      "\n",
      "Cosy rooms are done up using traditional Tibetan and Ladakhi furniture. Photo Courtesy: Kaya Dorje\n",
      "\n",
      "Breakfast wrapped up, I then made my way to my private cottage, a little farther from the dining hall. Standing in the doorway of what would be my home for the next two days,Shey Bhumi finally came into sharp focus. I was struck by how nature had been allowed to take its own course here with bare minimum interference, even for a property that advertises its rustic bona fides.\n",
      "\n",
      "The six-acre property included 10 cottages, in the local folk mode of a white-stoned square facade with a flat roof, lined with red beams on its borders. As opposed to a manicured landscape neatly designed for a postcard, each cottage was separated by wild grass and uneven bushes of sea buckthorn. Through the grassy outgrowth, there were makeshift wooden paths to each cottage, lined with lanterns intermittently.\n",
      "\n",
      "Inside the cottages, wooden floors, vintage chests, spacious beds with dragon motifs and carvings, subtly reinforced the theme of elegant outback comfort. Still, I imagine what visitors must come to SheyBhumi for was the money shot: a stunning and expansive view of the mountains, which flanked the retreat on all sides. My private cottage opened out to the Zanskar range while from the dining hall, you could spot the Ladakh range. To my dismay, a gloomy, grey filter had been pulled over both these scenes.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was only a day and a half later that I got my photo finish. Sawant had asked me to look out for a trifecta of colours—the azure blue sky, punctuated with snow-capped tips, and muddy tan slopes, sometimes with a hint of purple. Walking out onto my front porch, there it was: the multi-coloured swatch that had eluded me so far. Panorama shot, check.\n",

      "From atop the dining hall terrace, you can spy Thiksay Monastery. Photo by: ~Usergi15632539/Istock\n",
      "\n",
      "There is, of course, more to Shey Bhumi than mountain-gazing. Intermittent rain had played spoiler on my itinerary with the entry by road from Leh to Nubra Valley and Pangon Lake blocked. But I gleaned some cultural enrichment, devoting an entire day to Ladakh’s famed monasteries—Hemis, Thiksay and Spituk—all at a 20-30 minute ride from the property.\n",
      "\n",
      "In retrospect, I am glad because the seclusion only heightened Shey’s faraway appeal. I remember chancing upon Ancient Futures, a treatise on the Ladakhi people by Helena Norberg-Hodge, in the dining hall book collection. Norberg-Hodge celebrated the resilience of Ladakhi people, hoping that the modern life didn’t edge out a simple culture that cherished contentment. During my visit, everything had not gone as I had wanted but in the end, I was certain I left contented.\n",

      "\n",
      "There are moments when the therapeutic benefits of travel can hit home harder than any of the dispassionate advice received on a shrink’s couch. Displacement, in a strictly physical sense, clarifies both mind and body. For Kalki Koechlin, that breakthrough came during a trip to Karuna Farm, a nature retreat near Kodaikanal.\n",
      "\n",
      "Although she can’t quite trace the timeline—it was two-three years ago, she says—the circumstances that accelerated her existential crisis are still vivid. “I was in a state of transition with my divorce and a lot of changes in my personal life,” recalls the actor, alluding to her 2015 parting with filmmaker Anurag Kashyap. “Other things were happening at the time too like illnesses in my family and financial pressures.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Kalki and a girlfriend plotted a quick getaway to the south. “During our time at the farm, we went to the top of a mountain nearby and we did mushrooms. I remember feeling like the universe was breathing with me and that I wasn’t alone. And that everyone was connected.”\n",
      "\n",
      "By the end of her journey, Koechlin had arrived at “practical solutions” to many of her problems. If this flash of satori, Zen-speak for enlightenment, has a Kerouac-ian ring to it, that’s because stripped of her glamorous facade, the 33-year-old exudes the air of a happy beatnik.\n",

      "\n",
      "Koechlin is about to eat so she settles down in a chair, a plate of food in one hand and a glass of wine in the other. Between mouthfuls, she starts to talk travel. “For me, a trip has to fall into my lap. By planning too much, you are forcing yourself to have a good time instead of approaching it like you are going to learn from this experience.”\n",

      "\n",
      "It happens when I am saturated creatively. I can’t read. I can’t concentrate or even learn my lines. When it gets to that, I know I need to travel. It’s kind of like emptying the cup so that you can fill it up again. Before, I used to work like a headless chicken for a year-and-a-half and then suddenly feel like I am a failure. Then I would take four months off. Now I am trying to take shorter breaks but more often.\n",

      "\n",
      "I went back to my hometown Pondicherry almost two to three weeks ago. I am learning surfing at the Kallialay Surf School on Serenity Beach. I also go horseback riding when I am there, riding horses without saddles and a grip. There’s no way of controlling the horse except communicating with it. I used to ride as a child but stopped completely as an adult. Now I am back on a horse, after almost 12 years.\n",

      "\n",
      "My dad (Joel Koechlin) hitch-hiked from France to India in his 20s through places like Afghanistan and Varanasi. Travel was a way of life for him, like it was for many people in the 1960s and ’70s. He used to make paragliders, hand gliders and small aircrafts. So my childhood was filled with, you know, jumping off cliffs in a hand glider from the top of the mountain. And then a little later on, I was the one who had to drop him to the top of the mountain in a car and drive down by myself.\n",
      "\n",
      "With my parents, I remember some distinct trips. One was to the Himalayas. That was the first time I ever saw snow. I think I was eight or nine. We used to do a lot of treks in and around Mudumalai near Ooty, where I went to school. Then when I was older, I made my first trip to France to visit my grandparents. They lived near the Vosges Mountains in eastern France and there I learnt to ski. So yeah, I had a country bumpkin upbringing of sorts.\n",
      "\n",
      "When did you start travelling alone?\n",
      "\n",
      "When I was 18, I travelled with my then boyfriend, an English literature student, to Bodh Gaya and Manali among other places. We were both these young boho wanderers in love, going everywhere by train. We had just read Herman Hesse’s Siddhartha and would write poetry together. Then when I was at university in London (Goldsmiths), I travelled alone across Europe to many places. Spain, Amsterdam—of course (smiles knowingly).\n",
      "\n",
      "How do you like solo travel?\n",
      "\n",
      "Initially, I was not good at it. I was socially awkward. I wouldn’t know how to make friends. So my early trips were all about going to museums or reading my book at the beach… being a quiet and a good girl. Now I am better at travelling by myself. Two years ago, I accidentally ended up on a solo trip to Sicily. On the short flight there I made friends with this troupe of classical musicians. They were amazing. They took me to their concerts. Then from there, I went to some of the smaller beach towns near Sicily.\n",

      "Do you plan your travel at all?\n",
      "\n",
      "I always go with the intention of wanting my own space. It’s never about what am I going to do there. I am a nature person so I would much rather go to the mountains and go trekking. But if I am in a place like New York (her favourite city in the world), I want to be watching plays, going to museums, seeing stand-up comedy routines and music festivals. It’s about jumping on the bandwagon of whatever’s going on that week. There’s always someone who connects you to something else. And you find your way. During my recent trip to New York last month, I rode bicycles everywhere. I got to stop where I wanted and see the neighbourhoods properly.\n",
      "\n",
      "In Sicily, for instance, I was at a restaurant and seeing me by myself, the restaurateur began to chat with me. After a while, I was with his family—there were about 20 of them—with a grand matriarch sitting on a table. Somebody was playing the piano and there was all this food. It felt like a scene from The Godfather. I like it when a trip builds on its own organically.\n",

      "In all of this, you are just reminded of life and humanity. You realise that life exists outside your own bubble. And that it’s not the same but it’s equally difficult. People may think that just because someone lives in the mountains they must be so happy but that’s not the case, they have their own struggles. Travel is never about escapism for me.\n",

      "Speaking of the mountains, what do you like about them?\n",
      "\n",
      "Once a year, I try to go to the mountains… Kashmir, the Himalayas, the Northeast or in the south. It’s about the quietude and the vast expanse. My favourite place are the mountains near Karuna Farm, a place I find the spiritual. Whenever I am in the mountains, I am more meditative. If I am there long enough, I start writing. I also like going to Pondicherry to isolate myself and study my scripts closely.\n",
      "\n",
      "What was the most significant trip of your life?\n",
      "\n",
      "It was the visit to Karuna Farm I mentioned earlier. I was in a vulnerable place physically and mentally. At the farm, my friend and I met a guy named Hart, who was an out-and-out hippie, living in a thatched hut and everything. We ended up spending a lot of time with him. He went through a whole bunch of healing experiences with me. I returned to Mumbai with a clear idea of what I needed to do.\n",
      "\n",
      "Going to the mountains might have seemed like I was escaping but at the time, through all the conversations and experiences I had had, I came back with most of the solutions. That was when I decided that from here on, I would travel when I was saturated. It’s like that Buddhist tale about the turtle who yearns to be a dragon. But in order to be one, he has to leave his shell first.\n",
      "\n",
      "So does travel make for a more interesting person?\n",
      "\n",
      "Yeah sure, but not resort or package travel—that makes a person boring. It should be about making yourself available to the world around you rather than taking your world with you. The idea is to step out of your comfort zone and realise that there is something else happening in this world.\n",

      "Airbnb India’s Country Manager Amanpreet Bajaj on Making the World Home\n",
      "\n",
      "Amanpreet Bajaj is by all accounts a busy man, whose job entails taking a flight out to somewhere in this world at least once a month, but he is loath to consider himself a typical business traveller. Instead the India country manager of Airbnb, the online rental platform that has reinvented how people travel since 2008, prefers the new-age concept of “bleisure”. The explanation is self-evident: business trips that also afford some of the joys of unencumbered travel.\n",
      "\n",
      "In a conversation over the phone from his office in Delhi, 36-year-old Bajaj reveals that he had been travelling for work long before Airbnb. “I was lucky because I was a consultant (with Ernst & Young, India) early in my career. Part of that role involved constantly going to a different country to learn. The friends I made when I was in those places ensured that I was made to feel at home,” he says.\n",
      "\n",
      "In his consulting days, Bajaj would spend at least three to four weeks in a foreign location. “I worked through the week and then weekends were spent exploring whichever city or town I was in,” he says. That meant anything from spending hours roaming around Paris to dropping by the best restaurant in Amsterdam or checking out the latest hotspot in New York.\n",
      "\n",
      "Greece is a perennial favourite of Bajaj’s.Photo Courtesy: Amanpreet Bajaj\n",
      "\n",
      "Wanderlust runs in Bajaj’s family. His father owned a transportation business and any downtime was spent taking road trips, often through north India as they drove to meet relatives in Delhi. “My father was the kind of person who wouldn’t just drive from one location to another. He would stop at roadside dhabas, enjoy the sights and love to start a conversation with people. He encouraged me to do the same,” remembers Bajaj.\n",
      "\n",
      "It’s an ethos he has carried through to his dealings today. Thanks to travel, he has also picked up hobbies he never would have considered. Sailing is a fledgling interest. “I wouldn’t have ever considered sailing in India. I experienced it for the first time in Greece and because I had such a wonderful time, I now sail whenever I go there. I find someone who has a boat and we go to one of the islands nearby,” he says.\n",
      "\n",
      "Greece, sunny and postcard perfect, is a perennial favourite with Bajaj. Its genial hospitality and familial culture appeal to his Indian roots. “Greece is like another home to me. Everywhere you look, there are remnants of the country’s ancient history and civilisation. The people are warm and value family ties. And, the cuisine is delightful,” he says. In Athens, Bajaj’s usual stomping grounds are the local flea markets, in and around the city centre, or Brettos, one of the city’s well-known bars. “Brettos is the oldest distillery in Athens that serves ouzo (a traditional Greek aperitif), high quality brandy, and more than 36 different flavours of liqueur, many of which are not available in other establishments,” he reveals.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bajaj’s idea of fulfilling travel isn’t extreme, either in luxury or adventure. He prefers down-to-earth interactions with new faces instead. “Travel is a good way to realise that whatever apprehensions a person might have before he or she goes somewhere, the people they meet are probably thinking the same way. So that presents a great opportunity for cultural exchange and finding common ground,” he says.\n",
      "\n",
      "Switzerland is another favourite destination of Bajaj’s. “The whole country is so picturesque and the people are highly disciplined,” he says. Photo by Boris Stroujko/Shutterstock.\n",
      "\n",
      "Home or how to make people feel at home is a constant motif in his responses perhaps because Airbnb’s equity with travellers around the world depends on it. In November 2015, that skill faced its greatest test after a series of terrorist attacks shook Paris. Bajaj was there that night dining at Flora, along with some Airbnb hosts who were in town for an annual company event.\n",
      "\n",
      "“As soon as the news broke, we went to our Airbnb listing which belonged to a Frenchman,” he remembers. “We spent almost one-and-a-half days in his home trying to locate every employee and making sure they were safe. We couldn’t step outside but the French host was so kind. He called us to let us know that there was enough food in the fridge to last us during our stay there.”\n",
      "\n",
      "For Bajaj, that was a life-affirming moment and, according to him, it’s what travelling comes down to—forming real and authentic connections with strangers. And there’s no substitute for that. “I know that there’s talk these days of Virtual Reality (VR) replacing travel one day but all that will remain a novelty. As long as we are human, we will want to go to a place and feel it in our bones,” he says.\n",

      "Taste Trumps Travel…\n",
      "\n",
      "All of us take cues from our families on how to be or, in many instances, how not to be. When it came to food, I took from mine an open-minded appetite since much of mi familia was found wanting on that front. Anything new or foreign was viewed with wariness, at best, and derision, at worst. So I determined to try my damndest, like Seinfeld’s George Costanza, to do the opposite.\n",
      "\n",
      "In my pre-teens, there was a moment when this contrast came into focus. It was the 1990s; a simpler time when the average Indian palate was tentatively opening up to global influences. The occasion was a relative’s wedding reception with one of those multi-cuisine buffet spreads—mostly Indian and Indianised Chinese.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sometime during the proceedings, a dear uncle of mine (I might have to reconsider that “dear” after this revelation) marched to the buffet line and surveyed his options. A native of Kerala, he had lived in the state all his life and was authoritative, opinionated and possessed of a provincial mind-set, especially in matters of eating.\n",
      "\n",
      "At a counter that said Chinese chilly chicken, he stopped. I watched as he served himself a portion and stuck a forkful into his mouth. His head began to shake slowly and his eyes grew wider. Just like a music video playing in reverse, the fork went back in and out came the sampling.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What the hell is that?” he barked at the server standing behind the counter. The poor man smiled meekly and blurted, “It’s Chinese, sir.” “Well, no wonder it’s terrible,” my uncle shot back. With that sweeping generalisation, he had condemned this alien cuisine as unworthy of his respect.\n",
      "\n",
      "Needless to say, my uncle never did travel to China or, if I am assuming right, even felt compelled to visit a country whose food had produced such a violent reaction in him in the first place.\n",
      "\n",
      "I dredge this history up because at some point in their sojourns, foodies might confront a conundrum: would they travel to a place with a cuisine they don’t care for? A good friend is not the biggest admirer of Kashmiri food or typical Rajasthani fare. Dal baati churma? “Overrated,” she says. Ditto the legendary Kashmiri kahwa. But neither fact will dissuade her from going back to these places, in a heartbeat.\n",
      "\n",
      "I recall another friend, who had a short-lived romance with a dreamy Scot and the dreamier landscape of his country, during whic, she had to fake enthusiasm for Scotland’s famously disagreeable national dish—the haggis (a savoury pudding made of meat, onions, spices and oatmeal and cooked in a sheep’s stomach). Bland Scottish food, however, dimmed in comparison to the beauty of ancient castles and her knight in shining armour.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is significant where your first brush with a new cuisine occurs. In India, anything international is often diluted by fanciful contemporary trends or gauche local touches. And that early impression may leave some indisposed to a particular kind of food. Or worse, if you never try the real thing, you may forever live in blissful oblivion of what you are missing out.\n",
      "\n",
      "A few years ago, an acquaintance at whose home I had enjoyed many an Italian meal, travelled to Naples. Upon her return, I found that her white sauce-drenched penne, slathered in cheese, had changed. Her sauce was now a blanched tomato reduction, with only a hint of herbs, and plain olive oil. Over lunch, she then declared what a novice she had been all along, saying, “Things are done so simply in Italy. Indian continental places are the worst.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The proliferation of international cuisine restaurants has understandably fuelled a horde of poor parodies, which are not the greatest gateway into authenticity. A recent trip to Pattaya altered another pal’s view of the Tom Yum Soup that was served back home. “I haven’t ordered it at all since I returned from the trip,” she told me.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some of you, who are quite content with the native Tom Yum, may judge people like her to be purists but that is a natural side-effect of travelling extensively. The traveller’s heart hankers after genuine experiences. Cuisines will disappoint and delight in equal measure. It’s wandering into the unknown that is the real thrill.\n",

      "Leaning out from a bridge leading into Wat Rong Khun, I squint at a stucco moat of outstretched hands and grisly skeletons. Two massive horns arch over the walkway, while a few steps ahead, giant statues of Death and Rahu guard the entrance, like burly bouncers poised to restrict my entry into heaven. “The bridge of rebirth,” I overhear a foreign couple talking. A swampland of desire—enslaved arms—lie in wait blocking a mortal’s road to nirvana. This was rebirth as an infernal spectre, not Elton John’s PG-13 “Circle of Life.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Chiang Rai’s White Temple could stand in for a gonzo Disney dream, a lakeside monument studded with fragmented mirrors blinking from every inch. Artist Chalermchai Kositpipat, its eccentric creator, draws heavily from manic surrealism. He also loves allegory. White signifies the Buddha’s purity; glass denotes his luminosity. The bridge opens into a vast main complex, a safe space for souls free of want. Besides the usual aspects of a shrine, I saunter past some oddball touches—replicas of Iron Man, ghouls hanging from trees and a golden lavatory.\n",
      "\n",
      "Inside the temple’s principal hall, Kositpipat’s unleashes his freakish vision to the hilt in imposing Buddhist murals, spiked with late 1990s/early 2000s mainstream culture and fired through a space cannon. My eyes scan cosmic battles, the Twin Towers aflame, Neo from The Matrix, Elvis Presley, Michael Jackson and the notorious big Bs (Bush and Bin Laden). It’s symbolism in overdrive. Not far from here the souvenir shop hawks these mural scenes on smaller prints. I make a beeline for it. Seeking a want, you might rightly deduce. My soul shrugs as the bridge beckons.\n",

      "It’s before dawn at Horizon Village & Resort, in the rural outskirts of Chiang Mai’s Doi Saket district, and I am biding my time with Supriya, a photographer and my travelling partner on this trip. We sip tea in near silence on the lawn out front. A crew of staffers pump two deflated hot-air balloons, burners spewing fire into their openings. Our pilot, clad in a blue T-shirt, sizes up his passengers. Pointing at me, he implies that lightweights will go last. Behind him I catch the other balloon lifting off, so we pile awkwardly into our basket. Within minutes, Thai Captain Kirk steers us off. As he tinkers with the burner, he reminds us, “Depending on the wind, we can go high or stay low.” We play it safe for nearly 15 minutes. My fingers are tracing the outlines below, a tranquil garden of rice field squares but just when I have a lay of the land, our commander accelerates and the ground blurs beneath my feet. Our goal is to witness the sun’s earliest rays light up the sky’s Rothko blues, which it does in a flashy few seconds. Back on earth, we return to the resort, where we are toasted like Formula One drivers. Instead of trophies, we receive certificates. Bemusement is writ large on our faces, when Captain Kirk, holding an uncorked bottle of bubbly in one hand, signals. I step forward. Bend your head, he says. I follow, waiting for champagne to rain on me. The drink hits my hair like an icy trickle washing down this morning’s warm glow.\n",

Anutree, our spry Chiang Mai guide, had chalked out half a day for our exploration. She kicks it off with a light trek to the Doi Suthep, a mountain in western Chiang Mai, a wonderful vantage point to enjoy the province’s lush wonder. After the exertion, Bhubing Palace is a breeze, ideal for a lazy reverie along rose and orchid-sprouting pathways. From Bhubing, we ride upwards again to Doi Pui tribal village; a refuge of the ethnic community Hmong. Anutree guides us into a the living quarters of an elderly Hmong woman, dressed in a hemp skirt, with rough silver hair bundled up in an knot. It’s a tiny thatched-roof hut with dirt flooring and no doors or rooms for any purpose. Utensils are piled in a corner, in a rubble, along with discarded wood. Anutree tries to make conversation with the lady but she simply stares as though we are from a faraway planet. Later at the tribal market where some Hmong villagers sell their handicrafts, I walk out with a pair of hemp boots, unable to shake that withered face with pale grey eyes from my memory.\n",

But my journey till now had included its fair share of gold-rimmed temple trails. So I am restless for a not-that-quaint experience. MAIIAM Museum of Contemporary Art in San Kampheang promises to be an outlier. At first though, my senses scramble at the museum’s low-key simplicity; lately they’ve been attuned to florid classical architecture. I enter a plain, long rectangular warehouse, its facade overhauled with rippling glass tiles, refracting playfully in the sun. Inside, Spartan gallery units house a permanent display and temporary exhibits on two floors. MAIIAM owes its repository to a family of private collectors with a taste for contemporary Thai works.

This is the work of Sawangwongse Yawnghwe, a Burmese artist originally from Myanmar’s Shan state, also battered by a bloody past.

When we arrive at Khum Khantoke, inside a business park in Chiang Mai city, much of the ground seating circling the performance arena is already taken by hives of tourists and large family groups. Once the servers arrive bearing food, the steady hum of their incessant chatter subsides. Khantoke in Thai translates to a small dining tray with tinier bowls of food in it. Not at all difficult for an Indian to grasp—imagine a thali with the best of northern Thailand’s specialities. I can count eight bowls in my khantoke and, in one of them, the spicy chilli paste our guide had raved about earlier. The paste is to be eaten with steamed veggies but really, it can also be used as a side with the khantoke’s other dishes—minced pork in tomato sauce, dark red pork curry (also, Anutwree’s recommendation), banana fritters, sticky rice, fried rice noodles and crispy pork skin. Chowing down mouthfuls of pork crunch and chilli paste, I admire a bevy of women in gilded crowns swaying gracefully to classical Thai numbers. A slew of cultural variety acts follow, from dramatic war dances to mythical retellings. Even though riveted, minus any context, I am somewhat befuddled.

We aren’t the only hikers this morning; groups of birders and backpackers squirm past us along narrow rocky climbs. Waterfalls interrupt the forest scenery from time to time and after we rest by one such gushing cascade, we tread back to the start and part with our hiking guide. Anutree says she knows a great lunch spot and so, we set off for Doi Inthanon Royal Project, which is a farming research endeavour patronised by Thailand’s royal family. “The royal project is a source of income for the tribes,” Anutree tells us, while shepherding us in and out of agricultural glasshouses with all kinds of produce growing inside them. And it is this bounty that is used to cook all the dishes at the Royal Project Kitchen, where we settle in for a meal. From our table, I take in the scenic panorama of Doi Inthanon stretched out below. That view alone is worth the price of admission, I concur.\n",

      "\n",
      "After a tiring snorkelling session in the clear waters of Koh Phangan, instructors Captain Pumpui and Captain Poo are shepherding me and five others on a private speedboat to nearby Bottle Beach for a picnic lunch of sandwiches, macarons and fruit juices. I am about 10-12 kilometres from Belmond Napasai’s lush tropical resort in Koh Samui, my home for the last day-and-a-half, and the sun is blindingly bright overhead. This is ideal snorkelling weather; we have had a field day gasping at eels and corals underwater. But the heat has stymied chatter on our boat.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, the aquamen on board won’t have any lull. Blasting dance numbers from the speakers, Pumpui swivels his hips throughout the ride, Shakira-style, exhorting us to join in. We muster a few, muted rhythmic claps. Sometimes he pulls faces through a snorkel mask and, in another instant, casually hangs from outside the boat window like an impertinent daredevil. When Pumpui tires, he steers the boat and Poo takes over as cheerleader. I crack a bemused smile at their relentlessly sunny Laurel & Hardy routine. Perhaps every resort should have a slapstick comedy pairing on hand to liven up spirits.\n",

      "In Koh Samui, you can count as many luxury stays as the island’s ubiquitous coconut trees. I imagine a satellite map of its coastline would only show streams of beach umbrellas, striped towels and slope-roofed villas. Belmond Napasai, a 17-acre landscaped stretch situated in the north, has two things to recommend itself—a tasteful Thai countryside-inspired architecture that carves up enough spaces for repose, and a wonderfully unobtrusive atmosphere that allows every guest to be an island unto themselves.\n",
      "\n",
      "My room, a four-bedroom waterfront villa furnished in bamboo and sturdy wood with a central courtyard and an inviting pool, is utterly quiet; upon my arrival I pull back the balcony doors to let the sea’s gentle rumblings sneak in from time to time. For a moment, the set-up feels dauntingly sweeping—if I broke into an impromptu yell here, nary a leaf would flutter.\n",

      "A quick nap later, I saunter into Infinity, the resort’s lounge overlooking a freshwater zero-edge pool, which appears to be a favourite corner to commune for many guests. It’s dusk and the bar, right behind me, is open. I settle into a sofa with that resort cocktail staple, a pina colada. This is the best view in the house, with the water’s emerald green depths glinting at my eye, breeze rifling through open white tents on the lit-up beachfront below and tall balletic palm trees in the distance watching over the darkness. During my stay, I return to claim my seat here as often as possible.\n",

      "Mornings are opportune to set off on an ambling walk about the resort’s stunning and expansive grounds, embraced by tropical coconut and cashew groves, or schedule an appointment by the spa centre. On my third day, I emerge from a refreshing Thai massage, my limbs suitably twisted but so grateful. That night, my travel group meets the resort’s general manager, Jeroen Nettekoven, for an elaborate dinner at Lal Thai Restaurant. As the staff rolls in a scrumptious spread of spring rolls, satays and salads, Jeroen helpfully decodes what’s in front of us. I can’t get enough of the southern-style lamb gravy in shallots, peanuts and dark sauce and the sautéed morning glory, all served with fragrant, light rice, for the main course. Desserts present an even more delightfully difficult conundrum: we have a choice of Thai coconut layer cake, water chestnuts in coconut syrup and mango with sticky rice. By the time we conclude our meal, only the crumbs of the saccharine cake remain.\n",

      "Driving off from the resort, I rewind to my conversation with Jeroen, one afternoon, about the magnetic pull of Samui’s translucent sea. “Whenever I want a break from the resort, I take a boat and head off,” he had revealed, belying the tremendous strain of managing something that had the outward markers of serenity. “I am happy with those captains. They are colourful characters, no?” The mere thought of Pumpui and Poo unleashing their antics on a mild-mannered Jeroen is a perfect bookend to my blissed-out Samui adventure.\n",

      "\n",
      "As soon as a long, gleaming dark green train carriage, emblazoned with ‘Eastern & Oriental Express’ in engraved gold lettering slides into Hua Hin station, I feel a tinge of self-consciousness. Neither I nor my co-passengers from India are dressed for something this imperial. For the last hour, we have been milling about Hua Hin, Thailand’s oldest railway station—a quirky but fading royal artefact—in our baggy tees, jeans and dusty shoes, lugging backpacks and satchels. Once I hop aboard the train though, the air is less intimidating. While this is a majestic luxury locomotive boasting every accoutrement of refined sophistication, I see open, friendly faces in casual wear and summer hats.\n",
      "\n",
      "To be clear, our group is not actually travelling on the E&O Express, presently journeying between Singapore and Bangkok. We are only passing through, being shown around for a brief period by a senior manager in an impeccable grey suit. Launched in the 1990s, the Express’s carriages originally belonged to another train called the Silver Star, but they have now been refitted to reflect Indochina’s fine artistry and its Western past. We are in the train’s bar area, where both style elements compete for attention: the walls and flooring appear to evoke a colonial-era, upper-class gentlemen’s club with tanned teak wood panels. And then, there are more decorative finishes, which nod to Asian designs, from the train’s silken upholstery to its intricate marquetry on furnishings. Outside, Hua Hin’s landscape scrolls by, framed by windows, like a scene from a TV screen. The comfortable sofa-style seating is separated in the middle by a compact side table with an antique lamp. Reclining in one of the seats, I sense the appeal of spending a few hours catching a snooze with a half-read paperback resting on my lap.\n",

      "At local Thai train stations, the Eastern & Oriental Express attracts onlookers often hoping for that perfect selfie (top); The train’s jazzy bar (right), where cocktails have such names as Mist on the Rice Paddies, also hosts live music; Wood interiors inside the cabins (bottom) add to its throwback vibe.

      "Behind the bar counter, a spiffily attired bartender in a vest whips out a signature cocktail, presenting it with a smoke-filled grand finish for the cameras. The drink is there for our taking but there isn’t any time for tasting and we hurry on to the dining car for a meal cooked by the train’s chef Yannis Martineau. I dig into some duck that’s spiced in dark local sauces but retains the classic delicacy of French cooking; even dessert, usually a rich amalgam of milk, fruit and coconut in Thai meals, has a lightness to it.\n",
      "\n",
      "When passengers want to come up for air, they head to the Express’s observation car at its far end. En route, we pass a hallway of closed doors, our guide identifying them as sleeper cabins. For fans of Agatha Christie, the stuffy passage should jog a memory. After all, the Express was a backdrop for one of her most famous mysteries, finally unlocked by Hercule Poirot and his moustache twirl. Christie’s iconic work cemented the train as a world of slinky glamour, full of fashionable cloche-hatted beauties, imposing English dames and debonair playboys.\n",
      "\n",
      "The observation car is a beautiful wooden cabin with yellow lights on the ceiling. As we enter, it is busy. A well-heeled Chinese brood—grandparents, aunts, uncles and their young ones—has lined up against the main window to capture that elusive perfect family shot. Some guests are here for their post-lunch reverie. Some folks immediately can’t resist bringing out their cameras but most people appear glad to do nothing except watch the Express move through an unspoiled Thai countryside.\n",
      "\n",
      "It’s a prized view, all right, but is it worth a few thousand dollars? Aren’t there mountains to scale or planes to skydive out of for that kind of cash? I recall observing a tall blond American in the dining car on a table across the aisle, gently chatting with his grandfather, all shaky jowls and quivering fingers. The chef had stopped by their table to enquire, “Are you liking the food?” The old man, for whom speech had become an impediment, beamed a toothless smile that could light up the whole compartment. For his delighted grandson, that was a timeless payoff.\n",

      "\n",
      "The world’s greatest cities are brutal, unsentimental places, precisely the reason why so many of us fall so irrevocably under their spell. In its worst hour, this bond can curdle into bitter complaints of unrequited affection and everyday torment. “The subway doesn’t work, trash is overflowing and it’s too crowded; this is over.” Let me assure you that right now someone somewhere is uttering these words about your dream metropolis, New York, Rome, Rio De Janeiro. Like an unrepentant cad, the city laughs in their face, “Go on… live without me.” Wresting long-term connections comes with the occasional pang of nostalgic regret. Those who can’t escape their love of cities are destined to keep replaying that first flush of romance, that moment when a city went from a destination to home.\n",
      "\n",
      "A traveller’s sense of a city is always ephemeral. Not that this discredits his or her insights but to genuinely get under the skin of a modern metropolis, we look towards its people, leaning against its sidewalks, reading in café nooks or flirting in nightclubs. One of the best descriptions of city love I’ve read is in a wonderful book on London with a rather circuitous moniker: Londoners: The Days And Nights Of London Now—As Told By Those Who Love It, Hate It, Live It, Left It, And Long For It. In it writer Craig Taylor, who lived in the British capital for years, recalls relocating to Toronto and fielding that pesky question, “How do you feel about London?” He had a complicated answer, “It wasn’t a two-way relationship. It was no use thinking this place loses any sleep over me.”\n",
      "\n",
      "That’s the messy conundrum of a great city, as experienced by its besotted paramours, some of whom can’t kick the habit even if they tried. Travellers attempting to understand an urban jungle are better off trying to study its undercurrents. In September’s ode to five global cities, NGTI attempts to get a measure of their pulse. A writer dives into Belfast’s turbulent past to fully grasp its present-day vibrancy, another digs into the back alleys of Kuala Lumpur’s inimitable heritage food joints. We profile New York’s Hudson Yards, a gaudy spectacle that has divided New Yorkers, and chronicle the rise of Bauhaus in Tel Aviv. Finally we unpack Finland’s oldest city Turku.\n",
      "\n",

      "The Great Outdoors May Not Be Great for Long\n",
      "\n",
      "Part of the allure of a remote place is that the closer we get to it, the more we risk everything that made it precious. For years, Mount Everest inspired a sense of forbidden majesty, which was surmounted only by a few courageous adventurers. It helped that they were entertaining and we were content to immerse ourselves in the stories they wove from these monumental expeditions.\n",
      "\n",
      "In 2019, life-changing experiences are more easily found. This is probably why, when a photo of tourists lined up outside Everest’s summit, as though it were some check-in counter at an airport dispensing visas, was widely debated three months ago, the overwhelming emotion was deflated acceptance. No one in this day and age will be denied their Edmund Hillary moment.\n",
      "\n",
      "In February, the New York Times ran a panicked headline about another solitary paradise, which had long been removed from sustained tourist interference—the Galápagos. “Going to the Galápagos Is Easier and Cheaper Than Ever. That Might Not Be a Good Thing,” it warned. According to the article, “in 2017, 2,41,800 people visited the islands, up from 1,73,419 a decade earlier.”\n",
      "\n",
      "I am not highlighting these concerns as a spoilsport to anyone’s dreams. Travellers have earned their right to be wherever they choose to be. Even more so, seeking out the elusive is neither new nor groundbreaking; people were born of this earthly garden and returning to its comforting delights is the most primal of escapes. But the irony of how long we have this profusion of wilderness has not been lost, especially while we look towards the outdoors for constant nourishment and inspiration.\n",
      "\n",
      "Despite the arguments in favour or against these developments, NGTI’s August edition remains an ode to bona fide outdoor enthusiasts, a sincere testament to how faraway mountains, hidden islands, sweeping canyons continue to wield a magnetic pull over us. We have packed this issue with epic journeys: a 10-day road trip from Iceland’s deep grey volcanic outback, a tropical joyride in Fiji, a playful encounter with wildlife in New Zealand and a first-time skier’s tentative venture onto the slopes of Tahoe.\n",

      "Searching For Our Pop Culture Gods\n",
      "\n",
      "In this modern agnostic world, pop culture is the closest thing we have to a shared religion. Matinee idols, artists and rock stars are our gods and goddesses, feeding us an endless supply of enchanting lore and myths. For this movement to thrive though, it needs fans; followers who have gone beyond aloof observation. Pop culture requires that fans click below to subscribe, not let it just play in the background.\n",
      "\n",
      "One of my favourite explorations of fandom is Almost Famous, Cameron Crowe’s amusing semi-autobiographical movie about a wide-eyed teen writer and music geek, William, who receives the assignment of a lifetime when a magazine commissions him to join his beloved rock band on the road. William’s mentor is Lester Bangs, a senior critic with a hilarious zeal for mainstream culture. Lester would often launch into passionate defences of popular music, and a few lines from one fiery soliloquy, delivered to William in a diner, have always stayed with me. “The day it ceases to be dumb is the day it ceases to be real. Right? And then it will just become an Industry of Cool.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Pop culture is the industry of joy, I like to think. Its idols make our lives immeasurably more tolerable. We carry their songs in us, we live inside the fables they create. Sometimes, we travel to be reminded of them. Or other times, they recreate the places for us. Children of the nineties probably bought into two exaggerated but equally popular versions of New York, depending on what they watched—Friends or Seinfeld. If you grew up glued to the former, you thought the Big Apple was a city full of broke singletons who spent endless hours in coffee shops, cracking wise. If it was the other, your New York was a place with impatient eccentrics out to steal your soup recipe.\n",
      "\n",
      "In NGTI’s seventh anniversary edition, pop culture is the dominant conversation—travelling to relive the stories of famous movie stars, musicians, chefs and authors, to seek out their influences in the places they loved, from Colombia to Vietnam. Our contributors have handpicked their deities—Anthony Bourdain, Don Draper, The Beatles, Harry Potter, Shah Rukh Khan, among 18 names. We are true believers in these men, women and characters. Travelling in their shadow feels wonderful, delirious and appropriate. If this issue comes off as an unapologetic love fest, that’s entirely accurate. As Lester would put it, we are righteously dumb and hopelessly uncool.\n",

      "A Bombay Classic That Endures\n",
      "\n",
      "New and exciting has always received top billing in food—the latest fad, the newest restaurant, the trendiest neighbourhood, the healthiest diet. Often, these developments are accompanied by breathless pundit-like pronouncements: Lebanese is the new Chinese; Chinese is new Italian (wait, where does leave that Italian then?) A cuisine or dish has a moment, peaks and then becomes passé.\n",
      "\n",
      "While there is no shortage of cover versions, originals stand the test of time. And at National Geographic Traveller India, we confess to being partial to one classic. Creating and editing magazines in this day and age, with limited or, sometimes, binding resources, is a mental endurance test. Nothing makes the looming pressures more palatable than food. It is always on our mind. What gets us through the final sweaty hours, month after month, is an absolute Bombay fixture—the vada pav. We are a group of ardent foodies, and the deadline-hour vada pav toast is our modest tradition. Vada pavs are to Mumbai what hot dogs are to New York. Naysayers can knock the street staple all they want but we, at the magazine, are quite misty-eyed about our Bombaiya tastes.\n",
      "\n",
      "And for our collective money, there is no vada pav that quite matches Ashok Vada Pav, or the Kirti College vada pav, as it is casually referred to. The choice might feel obvious to insiders but it is well deserved. Vada pavs are simple—stick a fried potato ball with a sweet scintillating chutney in a fluffy bun; what can go wrong? But Ashok Vada Pav punches up with the zingiest combination of sauces and just the right cook on the vada, and tops it off with the showstopper—crispy fried crumbs of batter. Think of it as vada pav with fries.\n",
      "\n",
      "My thoughts on the vada pav can get more mawkish and graphic but suffice it to say that the pleasures of food are timeless. All the features in this month’s edition, from Pondicherry, Los Angeles, all over Europe, Laos and New Zealand, recall this essential aspect of travel. Regular readers can pick up any edition of our magazine and confirm our dedication to food. Our writers go to wondrous locations and more often than not, they return with stories of food, of how a single bite opened a fascinating world to them. Once a year, we devote our energy into creating a singular edition where ‘good food’ is not the sideshow of journeys. For that special issue, taste doesn’t seem incidental to storytelling, the spotlight follows it everywhere it goes.\n",

      "Redefining #Goals\n",
      "\n",
      "Once-in-a-lifetime is an overused expression in travel. Like everything else, the phrase has succumbed to a culture of instant hype. When every mountain hike, underwater dive or local meal is described with the glowing praise that should be meant for only the rarest of occurrences, it is difficult to tell a wonderful experience from a bucket list one. A bucket list just doesn’t translate with the same impact it was originally intended for.\n",
      "\n",
      "Why not reclaim the bucket list from this ordinariness? Travel goals, or at least the ones we file away under impossible, are defined by their incredulity. I would even go so far to suggest that if you don’t get laughed out of the room for your travel bucket list, you are doing something wrong. If it’s birthed in your imagination, why the restraint?\n",
      "\n",
      "A bucket list must elicit deep, almost-defeatist sighs or faraway looks. The appropriate response to photos of Arctic glaciers or Patagonian hikes is a sharp catch in your breath. It’s a recognition that as out of reach as a place seems, nothing can stop you from dreaming about getting there. It is poor little Charlie Bucket yearning that one day a strange man would welcome him into his outlandish chocolate factory.\n",
      "\n",
      "I empathise with Charlie because my earliest bucket list ideas were fictional too. As a kid, Tintin’s life of adventurous sleuthing across the globe seemed precious enough to envy. Adolescence was often spent in the thrall of Ray Bradbury’s stories from Mars. Adulthood, however, came with approachable aspirations and a Martian colony escapade was relegated to the fantastic realm. As time passes, bucket lists acquire a sort of silliness, like love letters from our past do, and many of us are content to keep them locked away, deep in our heart’s vaults.\n",
      "\n",
      "This month’s edition will hopefully dust the cobwebs off your bucket lists. If you have been lucky enough to tick off your dream destinations, then it may throw up new suggestions to start working towards. Either way, our compilation of 21 Journeys of a Lifetime does not take the word “lifetime” lightly. Sports fans can look forward to our guide to exploring England and Wales at the height of this year’s Cricket World Cup. Our treasure-island narrative from Fiji brims with enchantment, while more sophisticated types can dine off our drool-worthy dispatch from Dubai’s most extravagant hotel.\n",

      "Why Our Forests Need Watching\n",
      "\n",
      "J R.R. Tolkien was right to portray the Ents, hulking pieces of tall barks with sad eyes and mossy facial hair who guarded forests, as perhaps the most stoic figures in his Lord of the Rings trilogy. Their whole manner spoke to an endurance that seemed constantly on the verge of dissipation. They had seen and tolerated far too much in a world at war with itself. Yet they remained calm, like a steady lighthouse in torrential downpour.\n",
      "\n",
      "Treebeard, the oldest of these Ents, makes one of the wisest observations about Middle Earth and, if any of us think about it today, our Earth too. “I am not altogether on anybody’s side because nobody is altogether on my side…Nobody cares for the woods as I care for them.” I imagine his weary resignation is shared by this great planet’s animals and birds, especially its wild inhabitants.\n",
      "\n",
      "I’ll confess I have never been completely at ease in the jungle. I have enjoyed my few visits to national parks and sanctuaries but at the end of them, I have come away feeling like an intruder at a party, where no one approves of my appearance.\n",
      "\n",
      "But I do recognise that being in the wild is something everyone should attempt at least once in their lives. Notice how travellers on a forest safari often start unwittingly mimicking animal behaviour. They adopt stealthy stances behind thickets, sharply snap their necks about at the slightest indication of any movement or stand alert as if awaiting some imaginary clarion call. All this for a fleeting glimpse of a creature, who is either startled or unsettled by their presence. Animals are levellers; if we want to see them, it’s only fair we play by their rules.\n",
      "\n",
      "Chasing a wild animal also never succumbs to a pattern. Each time the excitement is unique, the story entirely unscripted and the heart, pounding and fully alive. Now, given what we know about the existential threats facing wildlife in the future, that experience is bound to be poignant too.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our wildlife special is packed with a slew of adventurous escapades from the woods, like two enthusiasts trailing the reclusive snow leopard in Ladakh and a writer looking back on the refreshing, quiet and unexpected thrills of Jim Corbett National Park. Some narratives shine light on getaways in crowded urban crawls such as wildlife hotspots in London. Others discover that forgotten tribes in India’s central parts are its finest sentinels. So yes, wildlife deserves to be seen thriving in its natural habitat. Go tiger-spotting, deer chasing or birding. As Treebeard said, the woods need all the watchers it can get.\n",

      "A Soulmate for Summer\n",
      "\n",
      "Every summer, the pastoral call of their motherland, Kerala, beckoned my parents. Their children would plead that they change direction at least for one year but these entreaties were dismissed as flakiness. Summer months were set in stone. And contrary to the breezy, game-for-anything attitude that the sun induced in many folks, for my mother and father, it was a season for constancy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kids, however, are enamoured of the new and for that reason my face developed a serious case of the ‘summer scowl’ for our family’s month-long sojourn away from the city. I held on to it as if it were my most precious accessory. Even in the midst of unbridled fun—summer in Kerala has a disarming way of wearing down the staunchest defences and a person can only sulk so much—I was quick to plaster the scowl back on. Any sign that I was enjoying myself would only encourage my parents’ loyalist tendencies, I figured.\n",
      "\n",
      "These days, my summers are as free as they can be. With providence and resources on my side, I could just as well spin the globe and pick a spot to summer at. But in the last few years, I have been searching for a tradition of my own making. Granted, the season is an exciting time of possibilities and a cue to throw caution to the wind. The unbearably same-old, same-old is made slightly not so, if only through temporary escape. As some of you would suggest, there’s no need to stay rooted in summer.\n",
      "\n",
      "Why this quest for a ritualistic journey to one place then? As light and frothy as summer is made out to be, it has long been associated with routines. Caucasians descending on Bali for their annual surf-and-yoga retreat, millennials on a camping trip to the Western Ghats, elderly couples heading to Mussoorie for a respite from the heat or die-hard road warriors planning their yearly summit to the mountains are all creatures of seasonal habit. Everyone has their go-to destination and it’s one where they try to create an idyllic alternate universe.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some of our readers may already have their summers planned. I imagine there are those, who will be following paths they have tread before. For others, NGTI’s summer issue has much to choose from—a scrumptious gelato-sampling feast in Italy, a charming rustic getaway on a Ratnagiri farm, an immersive trip to the holy land in Jerusalem and an artsy trail of Monet’s favourite haunts in Normandy, France. Perhaps, by the end of this summer, we would have found a place to call our own, a refuge to return to over and over.\n",

      "How Deep Is Your Travel Love?\n",
      "\n",
      "If there is a phrase I would prefer to retire from online bios, personal or professional, it is, “I love travel.” Or some approximation of that sentiment. To clarify, I am not against travellers or those who proudly flaunt their passion for travel. On the contrary, editing a travel magazine has now made me oddly protective of travellers and their ilk. My submission is that “love to travel,” suggested so casually, just doesn’t feel adequate to the depth of emotion it sparks in true devotees.\n",
      "\n",
      "In February, the month of love as endowed by our great gifting industrial complex, we are wrestling with what “love for travel” means in tangible, life-affecting terms. The early throes of discovering travel might not be too dissimilar to the beginnings of a feverish affair. A fleeting scene, sound or feeling that at first arouses, then enchants and eventually, lures us into a hypnotic state, evoking woolly-eyed reveries about what could be.\n",
      "\n",
      "This world, however, is not the most conducive for long-term passion, the kind that demands unflinching sustenance in the midst of distractions from a thousand notifications. Passion has many rivals to contend with. And in flippantly announcing travel as our first love, we are not fully considering the influence our other paramours (work, relationships or money) exert on us.\n",
      "\n",
      "Travellers for life are compulsive. They have to be; there is no other existence. Climate change, marriages, deaths, protests and politics might have to take a backseat. I am reminded of a wanderlust-happy couple that discovered chinks in their relationship during a road trip through Russia. The woman, upset and distraught, offered a solution: cut the trip short to come back home and rekindle their chemistry. The man, however, wouldn’t give up Siberia, despite a chance at a do-over. Please don’t go getting any ideas about breaking hearts but for some travellers, marital bliss too has its limits.\n",
      "\n",
      "In finding stories about travel as a lifetime affair, we looked for longevity. We chose accounts of love, which tempered by the prospect of actually living, may have assumed a subdued tenor. But it only took a remembrance or flicker to fan the ardour all over again. One budding artist writes of her admiration for Frida Kahlo, and a Frida-inspired pilgrimage to Mexico. One of our own staffers takes a mental journey back to the cities and countries that have bookmarked her blossoming long-distance affection while a mountaineer outlines why the solitude of the Himalayas will never fail to captivate her.\n",
      "\n",
      "Falling in love with travel is much like falling in love with a song. You wear it out until it makes you sick. But you have to be foolish and always full of song.\n",

      "Travel Inspiration for 2019 : A Book on Nietzsche and Hiking\n",
      "\n",
      "One of the finer books I read this year was John Kaag’s Hiking With Nietzsche, in which Kaag, a professor of philosophy, rekindles his passion for the German thinker while tracing picturesque hiking trails in the mountains of Switzerland. It’s a near-precise rendering of the travelogue as a self-help book. A young Kaag was an avowed Nietzsche acolyte but given the ravages of responsibilities and adulthood, the writer put his affinity to test by undertaking physically enduring hikes through the Alps, revisiting haunts that the philosopher escaped to, in search of solitude and salve. The journey’s demands, coupled with his own inner turmoil, are catnip for anybody feeling at cross purposes with their own life.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the book, Kaag quotes Neitzsche writing to his mother after he had spent time in Splügen, “I was overcome by the desire to remain here… this high alpine valley… There are pure, strong gusts of air, hills and boulders of all shapes… But what pleases me the most are the splendid highroads over which I walk for hours.” Travel as the answer to searching questions is hardly a radical idea but what’s endearing about the book is that it subtly confirms a basic tenet of why we go on these journeys in the first place. Sometimes, being on the move matters more than anything else. Meandering through his hikes with his wife and child, Kaag faces endangering moments. He doesn’t always accomplish what he set out to do. “Slipping” is as important as climbing, he insists, and he persists.\n",
      "\n",
      "Travel writing’s bogeyman, I have been told again and again, is the Internet. Information and narrative are in abundance from tourists traversing to parts of the world that were once inaccessible with frequency. Where to go, how to go there, and what to do once a person is there is now easily definable. And if more catastrophic visions of the future are to be believed, one day an algorithm will do it better than any of us.\n",
      "\n",
      "What must then a travelogue accomplish? Kaag’s book reminded me that it was to establish an intimate and immediate human connection to a place. This can never be rated highly enough. Travel is as much about geography as it is about people, in lands that don’t inhabit our minds as often. It’s an urgent hammer taken to the numbing solipsism and drudgery that modern living descends into. It is storytelling, which never gets old.\n",
      "\n",
      "As another year dawns, NGTI has an exhaustive compendium of places, beloved and obscure, from across India and the world that should find its way to any adventurer’s 2019 itinerary. Travel, for all its ubiquity, still has plenty of seduction left in it.\n",
      "\n",
      "What Dreams May Come\n",
      "\n",
      "Our year-end edition toasts ultra-indulgence while travelling, featuring itineraries that many will know to be out of their financial reach. In producing these narratives, I was struck by a contrast.\n",
      "\n",
      "Travel today is dominated by minimalists or downsizers, those who preach the gospel of “hard-knock wanderlust.” And they almost always reap universal admiration. They are characters to aspire to, examples of made-for-Instagram sayings such as, “All you need is a backpack” or “#MotorcycleDiaries.” Unable to join these gallivanting philosophers, others marvel at their brave rebellion—oh, to give up the predictability of overpriced tourist traps someday, they sigh.\n",
      "\n",
      "In this context, luxury travel evokes a Molotov cocktail of feelings. A billionaire on a sailboat hosting Jazz Age-style revelries in the French Riviera is inevitably setting himself up for mockery. The heiress, who flits off to shopping holidays in Milan and Dubai, might as well buy an extra pair of sunglasses for the shade directed her way. Extravagance passes muster if it panders to affordability. In the last few years, it has become intertwined with entitlement, a radioactive pejorative today.\n",
      "\n",
      "Upper-class travel doesn’t deserve this slight. As more astute aesthetes have reminded us in the past, refined tastes don’t have to be gauche. Living like royalty might have its privileges but it also spurs a temperament for beauty, grace and sensuality, which is why travellers will always fork out top penny for a night in Rajasthan’s many palace stays.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wealth facilitates the kind of understated exclusivity seen in the English countryside’s several castles or manors, once a venue for elegant ballroom dances. Luxury could also simply mean time well spent—or doing nothing—floating atop a sundeck in an unending stretch of the ocean.\n",
      "\n",
      "Professional travel writers are lucky to be granted access to these private paradises and, in December’s magazine, a handful of them have returned with colourful dispatches. One writer enjoys a happy recreational bubble in the Maldives, another is privy to up close views of big game in Botswana. There is also a roundup of New York’s elite food and drinking haunts, and coverage of the maiden cruise between Mumbai and Goa. All these retreats promise a hedonistic binge: grand feasts of fine wine and champagne, and views hidden from the typical trails.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some of them will test your purse-strings but think of Holly Golightly. She couldn’t lay claim to real Tiffany’s jewels but that never stopped her from getting her heart’s fill, standing outside the window.\n",
      "\n",
      "Free on the Outside\n",
      "\n",
      "The great outdoors, around which our November edition pivots, is a deceptive catch-all, as such phrases tend to be. In day-to-day conversations, anything from after-school camping trips to sailing in the waters of Papua New Guinea risks being lumped in the same breath. But whoever put their mind to the term was no doubt thinking of great with a capital G. They were dreaming of outdoors that offer as much dislocation as possible. Where snow peaks rise out of clouds and canyons plunge the recesses of the earth.\n",
      "\n",
      "Geoff Dyer, one of travel journalism’s finest exponents, calls this a “sense of elsewhere.” Writing of an aunt, who sent him postcards from the southwest of America when he was in school, he recalls, “Hilda sent me brochures from places like the Painted Desert, the Petrified Forest and Monument Valley. These were landscapes I had glimpsed in Westerns, but the fact that someone I knew had been to them—had proved that they were real—gave me my first real sense of elsewhere.”\n",
      "\n",
      "My elsewhere memory from childhood doesn’t conjure anywhere near the same eloquence but it was just as resonant. One of my father’s favourite films was David Lean’s Lawrence of Arabia, perhaps a result of spending over a decade in the Middle East. He often sent long letters from his travels and, in one of them, he mentioned setting eyes on the desert for the first time, and feeling as if he was having his own T. E. Lawrence moment.\n",
      "\n",
      "Years later, watching the classic was an equally transporting experience. Each time, Lean’s camera dissolved from close-ups of Peter O’Toole’s mysteriously phlegmatic Lawrence to the sunlit sand dunes, bleeding out of the 70mm screen as it were, the impact was transcendent. For me, the desert was as elementally stark as outdoors got, Martian in its unfamiliarity and removed from all modern signifiers of life.\n",
      "\n",
      "Narratives dedicated to the outdoors must, therefore, pin down what it is like to be swept up in the enormity of nature. In this issue, trekkers will identify with one writer’s exultations at the end of her journey to the Everest Base Camp. A mind-expanding immersion in Australia’s Northern Territory is peppered with characters who gave up urban comforts for a life in the wild.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the less-frequented parts of Yellowstone National Park, another solo traveller descends into solitude. We also encounter a different Hong Kong, hiding green bounty beyond its skyline. Somerset Maugham believed that the wise traveller only travelled in his or her imagination. It’s true, the latter is unmatched but even a fevered imagination can only be nourished from being in the great outdoors.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the Mood for Winter\n",
      "\n",
      "Summer is a charming flirt. Easy-going and casual. Summer doesn’t huff and puff to win our affections. It has us at “Hello.” Winter broods like the tortured protagonist of big fat Russian novel. It is daunting and dramatic, burning with a slow intensity.\n",
      "\n",
      "The season’s reputation precedes itself, and often, not in a good way. It has a way of whittling down everything to its bare bones. Even relationships not attuned to its ebbs and flows can fray. At a dinner conversation I once attended, I listened in bemusement as a recent divorcee made the case that it was the Scandinavian frost that had cooled his ex-wife’s ardour. How original.\n",
      "\n",
      "Winter travel is an exercise in negotiation, especially for sunshine souls. “How many extra clothes do I have to pack now?” “The weather is minus-what-did-you-say?” All valid concerns but the recommendations far outweigh them. Take one trivial scoring point: the winter wardrobe, which is tres chic, and can make the most sartorially challenged among us look like runway models.\n",
      "\n",
      "The allure of winter lies in nature—so immense, overwhelming and, of course, achingly beautiful. In his collection of letters to an unborn daughter, Norwegian Karl Ove Knausgård meditates on the sounds of the season. “The screech of a crow, for instance, which in summer is just one note in a greater tapestry of sound, is in winter allowed to fill the air alone, and every single nuance in its rasping, hoarse, seemingly consonant-filled caws stands out.” Winter’s silences are missives from a distant world, electric and profound.\n",
      "\n",
      "Solitary revelations aside, winter can match summer for convivial fun. Think of Yuletide. Is there a more exuberant time of the year? To me, it’s the greatest incentive to plan a December trip to the west. To experience Christmas in its festive splendour, in all the clichés from postcards and fairy-tales.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our October edition has delightful winter escapes, spanning some of the prettiest landscapes in Europe. Finland is an underrated joyride, marked by reindeer rides and an unforgettable trip to catch the Northern Lights. In the Swedish city of Gothenburg, a Delhiite grapples with the quirks of winter anew. Paris in December remains the lovers’ rapturous fever dream while Copenhagen is a dizzying array of winter activities. In addition to which, an amateur and a professional offer differing accounts of skiing in Switzerland and Gulmarg.\n",
      "\n",
      "Unlike summer, winter is not a flash in the pan. But if those great novels of the past are any indication, you will get lost in the story of winter with every page you turn.\n",

      "Slow Days, Fast Company\n",
      "\n",
      "In the mid-2000s, I had the first of my several brushes with unemployment. This was no well-considered sabbatical. Instead it was a surprise shove that came out of nowhere. Losing a job is crushing but even more so if you are the only one. In the company of a few colleagues though, your shoulders droop less and the gloom takes on a lightheaded spin. You cloak despair in disdain, adopting a “What, me worry?” face. And then, you blot the world, and travel.\n",
      "\n",
      "So I accompanied one of my friends back to her hometown, Guwahati, where I was to join her mum and dad on a road journey to Shillong, and if the weather held steady, onward to Cherrapunji. The choice of Cherrapunji puzzled me initially for as far as I could tell, it was that place where it rained constantly. There were enough clouds hanging over me, I thought to myself.\n",
      "\n",
      "But since my arrival, my friend’s father, who is no more, had been keen on us travelling by road. He was a looming presence, with a fondness for fine booze and house parties. I remember that trip now in snatches—Guwahati (quiet and hilly), Shillong (cool long before cool was invented), homemade khao suey, bootleg liquor shacks along the border between Assam and Meghalaya, and a worn-out CD of Vivaldi in the car.\n",
      "\n",
      "The overwhelming memory I have though is of the Shillong-Guwahati highway, where locals peered out of tin-roofed houses and roadside shops hid culinary delights I had never encountered. And my host, stepping on the gas as if his modest SUV were an Italian speed monster. Driving unfettered always unleashed his inner outlaw, my friend would recall later. For a young me, he held an invigorating promise: Old age was fun and wild provided there were more road trips.\n",
      "\n",
      "Often, the way the world travels now—take a flight and run down a list of experiences—feels as if we are settling for watching trailers instead of entire movies. Road trips fill the gaps in places you think you know.\n",
      "\n",
      "That’s why NGTI always celebrates a breadth of road experiences. Some, featured in this issue, are familiar, like a bike ride through the outskirts of Barcelona, a family holiday in Australia and a jaunt through ancient Greece. Others, like a van ride through Mongolia and a illustrator’s perspective of the Californian coast, are utterly singular.\n",
      "\n",
      "The best part about road trips? They are versatile. They can be joyous in the company of family and friends, and if you are lonesome, you can rely on the road to always keep you company.\n",
      "\n",
      "Train to Nowhere\n",
      "\n",
      "I like a bit of pow-wow in any place. Let me rephrase before you think I am eternally hankering for a fight. What I mean is I would choose crooked streets over straight highways, sweaty mayhem over pristine elegance. This is why no matter where I go in this world, coming home to India, and especially Bombay, is never dull. I blame growing up in the city for my pugilistic predilections. One of the many descriptors that Mark Twain used in relation to Bombay was “pow-wow.” The place seemed to confound him: “Bewitching”, “Bewildering”, “Enchanting”, “Arabian Nights come again?”—the man was repulsed and riveted at the same time. It was a place befitting the number of exclamations he used.\n",
      "\n",
      "At 13, I was yet to be permitted the pleasures of travelling unchaperoned outside Bombay but within its confines, I had free rein to indulge my inner flâneur. I became the weekend loafer, slacking through parts of the city I really had no business being in. My itinerary hardly ever changed: Take the BEST bus to Chowpatty; after filling up on chaat, sample some more at the khau gully in Churchgate; sometimes, pretend to shop for music I could not afford at Kala Ghoda’s Rhythm House, where the desperately-trying-to-be-hip hung out in the 1990s. The final stretch was always my favourite: trudging along to my personal Shangri-La, Victoria Terminus.\n",
      "\n",
      "At VT, I parsed the sea of faces. I drummed up mind games to fill time like “Who’s new and who isn’t?” Spotting either was fairly simple. The former bunch bears dazed glances and open mouths. A person gyrating through the mob with minimum physical contact had been practising for the Local Train Olympics for a few years at least. When it was my turn to head back to the suburbs, I warmed up, adopted a stance that would make Usain Bolt proud and dashed off like the Flash into an incoming train. Like millions of others, Bombay taught me independent travel, in the crudest sense of the term. And it prepared me for the swirling madness that lies in the rest of India.\n",
      "\n",
      "In August, we are showcasing and extolling the allure of domestic journeys. Hampi, celebrated for its ruins, reveals something unexpected after every visit. In Hyderabad, we feature Sufi shrines, some of which abound in nooks you wouldn’t notice. Banaras’s cosy classical music cafés leave a lasting impression on a newcomer’s heart, and in West Bengal, a heritage renaissance seems to be afoot in Serampore. It is incumbent that travellers make forays far from where they live but, every so often, it doesn’t hurt to stumble upon surprises in our own backyard.\n",

      "Six Years And Counting…\n",
      "\n",
      "Anniversary editions have the feel of a graduation: a year of studious slogging (of which, truth be told, my team and I do very little) and madcap fun (which we only wish we could indulge in more) rounded off with a sense of achievement and lingering anxiety. There’s pride that National Geographic Traveller India has lived to see another day, and in today’s precarious media landscape, that should account for something. Then the gnawing question: did we get it right?\n",
      "\n",
      "When it comes to travel, is there a right or a wrong way to do it? Early this month, The New York Times unearthed Albert Einstein’s entries of his journeys around Asia and discovered a surprising side to the Nobel Prize winner. About his time in mainland China he wrote, “In the air there is a stench of never-ending manifold variety.” The people, he found, were “industrious, filthy, obtuse…” Travel often functions as a Rorschach test of biases.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some are acutely aware of this and spend their time making amends. Anthony Bourdain’s recent passing prompted glowing tributes from around the world to his open-minded exploration of parts and cultures unknown. There are others who stand their ground: If a traveller’s true sentiments veer towards exotification, maybe it should stay so.\n",
      "\n",
      "Read Indian-American author Akhil Sharma’s recounting of a fortnight in Japan, featured in this issue, for a perfect example. The counter to which, also in this edition, are the observations of three insiders on their hometowns: Member of Parliament Shashi Tharoor sings paeans to Thiruvananthapuram, musician Raghu Dixit toasts Mysore and writer Janice Pariat reminisces about Shillong.\n",
      "\n",
      "The “how” of travel is a matter of debate too. Dyed-in-the-wool snobs harp on about authenticity and immersing yourself in local culture. The more you are inconvenienced, the more real your journey. To which, casual travellers will respond with, “I will take my comfortable stay in a nice hotel, thank you very much.” NGTI’s sixth anniversary is a distillation of these myriad attitudes to travel. In their own way, our writers show you the “right way to do it.”\n",

Chinmai Gupta offers a guide through that most “mystical” of institutions—a London nightclub.

      "Getting Saucy About Food\n",
      "\n",
      "For my money, memorable disagreements often centre on food. A friend who was about to settle abroad was feeling particularly wistful about a storied south Bombay restaurant, the kind of eatery that locals like to call “overrated” and guidebook-toting tourists faithfully make a beeline for. His favourite on the menu? The baklava—a dry fruit-laden traditional sweet that smacked of decadence in every bite.\n",
      "\n",
      "The first time he requested for the dessert at the restaurant, its eccentric owner was not impressed. Sizing up his credentials, he asked, “Have you had baklava before?” “Yes.” “Where?” “In Turkey.” Suspicions confirmed, the gentleman chided him. “Arre baba, that is the Turkish baklava. This is the Iranian one…” What followed was a 10-minute tutorial on the precise ways in which they differed, part-comical and part-endearing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Forget the grand battles for identity being waged around the world, food drives everyday culture wars. They are infinitely more interesting and the only injury caused is to one’s pride—we could all use some schooling on that front. Besides, unlike spikier tiffs, these usually end in smiles and a knowing wink.\n",
      "\n",
      "Last year I was perusing dinner options at Le Goutillon, an unpretentious French bistro in the heart of Chantilly. After four days in the country, most of my companions were satisfied with their fill of meat and wine, and chose conservatively. However, I and another compatriot were feeling emboldened (perhaps, it was the glass of red) and scanned the chalkboard menu for more adventurous fare. “Bring us the steak!” we declared.\n",
      "\n",
      "When our substantial cuts of beef arrived, it was soon revealed that we had held our appetite in unwarranted esteem. At the end of that meal, Goutillon’s server—a stern, no-nonsense woman—took an eyebrow-cocked look at our barely empty dishes and shook her head in disapproval. A local hotel manager later reminded us of our misplaced bravado. “Oh yeah, I heard about the Indians who didn’t finish their steak!” he giggled. France 2; India 0.\n",
      "\n",
      "In this time’s food special though, India’s showing is strong. Bombay Canteen’s Chef Thomas Zacharias, a flagbearer for all things desi, picks his top 10 must-haves from across the country.

      "\n",
      "In 2008, the comedy Bienvenue chez les Ch’tis gave France’s north the image boost it had long been craving. There is a famous scene in the movie where the protagonist is summoned by his superior, who is about to deliver grave news. “Fired?” guesses the hero. “No, worse,” comes the reply. “Transferred.” When our hero finds out that he is to be positioned somewhere up north, he is mortified.\n",
      "\n",
      "In conversations with newcomers to France’s north, locals often bring up the film. As one resident memorably told me, “First, ze hero is crying because he come to ze north. By ze end, he is crying again… but zis time, because he iz leaving.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The region, officially known as the Hauts-de-France, has been unfairly characterised by many in France as unsophisticated. But any proud northerner will assure you that this is only because it remains underappreciated. I spent four days across four towns—Lille, Le Touquet, Amiens and Chantilly—and returned with ample stories to tell.\n",

      "Isabelle mutters, “I loved the old church, the beautiful church. Not this thing on the outside.” Construction on the cathedral began in 1854, but it was halted after the two world wars. Finally, in 1999, the incongruous front was hurriedly erected.\n",

      "Le Touquet could well be fashioned from the pages of a glossy brochure, the sort where impossibly handsome aristocratic faces frolic on white sandy beaches. An affluent seaside neighbourhood, it’s located an hour from Calais along the Côte d’Opale (the Opal coast), and has long been a swanky retreat for “old money”, not just from France but from all over the world.\n",

      "Members of British high society have had traditional ties to the place. In the past, frequent visitors included Winston Churchill, Prince Edward and Wallis Simpson, playwright and director Noel Coward and P.G. Wodehouse. For many Brits, Le Touquet still retains its sheen. Estelle Dubail, my local guide, confirms the town’s elite antecedants saying, “Several families from the U.K. have their holiday homes here.”\n",
      "\n",
      "In September, when I am here, Le Touquet has fallen silent. Summer nearly wrapped, the town’s swish set has left and the streets wear a deserted look. At the height of peak season (June-August), I might have walked in on sunnier scenes: athletic and toned torsos tanning by the lido; elegantly attired retirees engaged in spirited contests across golf courses and tennis courts; coin slots ringing in casinos; the art deco market near Rue Saint Jean humming with fashionable shoppers; stately manors and pretty villas hosting rip-roaring banquets.\n",

      "All is not quiet though. There are some who make the most of even the leanest season. During a leisurely lunch at Spoon, a modern French restaurant overlooking the greens of La Mer, I spot two raucous teams of older gentlemen teeing off. La Mer is one of three courses at Le Touquet Golf Club, the most prominent golfing facility here.\n",
      "\n",
      "Golf is obviously the sport du jour in any resort town; in Le Touquet, horse riding and bicycling remain popular too but the sport that fascinates this town is sand yachting. Simply put, the activity involves reclining inside a yacht on three wheels, and manoeuvring it on the beach with the help of sails.\n",
      "\n",
      "My group of five travellers is about to get a first-hand immersion in the sport. We head to the Centre Nautique de la Manche Bertrand Lambert, where our painfully amateur attempts are monitored by instructor Jean Bernard Bacquet. Jean is hawk-eyed and brusque, barking directions at us—“You will all fix your own sails without any help.” So we do just that, lift our yachts and position ourselves inside it lying down and holding tight to the rope attached to our sails. Bacquet sets us off, but steering the yacht in a straight line as the wind bears down on us is a daunting prospect.\n",
      "\n",
      "More than once, my yacht loses steam, swerves like a car losing control and crashes into the waves. Then, on the third or fourth attempt, with a little nudge from Jean, my sail gains momentum and I glide forward. It’s a minor victory but my loud whoop decidedly proves it meant far more.\n",

Julia is right—the cathedral demands hours of study.\n",

The latter also houses Musée Condé (the Condé Museum), which possesses an art collection only second to the Louvre in Paris. Any credit for the chateau’s survival should go to the Duke of Aumale, the last Prince of Condé, who inherited it and ensured it remained intact through wars and revolutions.\n",

Purely for fun.”\n",

At La Capitainerie, a fine-dining establishment inside the chateau, Olivier Malherbe from the castle’s management team regales my group with tales of royal carousels during the reign of Louis XVII. “The carousels were about the connection between the rider and his horse, and the demonstration of this through exercises,” he says.\n",

Within minutes, the white moussey concoction is polished off.\n",

      "Olivier and his horse-riding instructor Delphine, a boisterous American transplant to Chantilly, later join us on a jaunt around the impeccable gardens.

      "It had been a dismal evening for Harpreet “Happy” Dhillon. He veered his open-air green Gypsy to a halt outside a crowded ticketing window in Kanha National Park. Lanky, bearded and soft-spoken, he was a naturalist from the Kanha Earth Lodge, my home in Madhya Pradesh for three days. Happy had driven me and my companion—photographer Riddhi Parekh, on her maiden wildlife assignment—all across the park in search of a memorable tiger sighting.\n",
      "\n",
      "That evening, we had concluded our final drive in the Kisli Zone, where we had missed seeing a cat by seconds. Three days. Zero tigers. I was certain that Happy was kicking himself.\n",
      "\n",
      "As soon as we were out of one of the park’s two main entrances, a fellow guide yelled from across the ticket counter, “Happy, tune tiger dekha?” Happy smiled—the kind of tight smile that threatens to dissolve into a scowl—and shook his head. Then, the knife-twist. A guide handed Happy a smartphone. “Wasn’t this T2?” he asked, as we stared at the photo of a tiger blankly. Happy, outsmarted once, was not to be outdone again. “No,” he assured the man. “I think it was one of the new male tigers.”\n",

      "\n",
      "I had caught my breath a lot. Wintry morning drives across Kanha can do that to you. The park’s scenery changes dramatically. Swaying sal trees, quiet streams, muddy swamps, bamboo thickets—the landscape unfurls like nature’s own flipbook.\n",
      "\n",
      "My residence—the Kanha Earth Lodge, in the outer reaches of the park’s buffer zone—was so artfully conceived that I felt it was one with the greater ecosystem of the park. Comprising 12 luxury cottages, fashioned after local tribal architecture, the lodge evoked an outdoorsy western ranch in spirit, albeit with Indian aesthetics. The stone setting in the walls was asymmetrically precise, while the wood furniture inside and outside the 12 terracotta-roof cottages—sinewy and graceful.\n",

      "Covering 16 acres of land, the property included an organic garden, an infinity pool and a main cottage where guests trickled in to lounge by a huge fireplace.

      "\n",

      "It was our last night at the lodge and we were being treated to a bushfire dinner under the stars. Digging into kebabs, we laughed off our consecutively unsuccessful tiger chases.

      "\n",
      "Alone in my treehouse, I walked onto the deck and surveyed the view—40 acres of dry wilderness. Each of the six treehouses were at a significant distance from each other. So I only had the immediate company of my avian neighbours to look forward to. In the daytime, nature’s seclusion felt more welcome than wary.\n",
      "\n",
      "Night was a different matter. We were warned to never step out of our treehouse without a flashlight; any impromptu solitary adventures were discouraged. “There can be snakes here sometimes,” Harish Arya, lodge manager revealed, casually waving out to the woods.\n",
      "\n",
      "During our walk at dusk though, there was no unexpected slithering to be heard. Chinmay was keener on spiders, shining his light on a geometric web, woven by an orb spider, caught between two twigs. He stuck his forefinger into the web, “Look how it sticks in the centre but seems to be invisible as it expands towards the edges,” he whispered in admiration. “This is how they catch their prey.”\n",
      "\n",
      " \n",
      "\n",
      "Back at the pool and dining centre, Chinmay doled out more food for thought with a slide show about Pench’s main attractions—prime among them, a legendary tigress called Collarwaali. “She is quite bold and doesn’t care if tourists are around or not,” he offered. She wouldn’t mind us then.\n",
      "\n",
      "Through dinner, as we wolfed down chef Pankaj Fulera’s eclectic fusion menu (makai ki khees, chicken ravioli, beetroot halwa), the conversation remained tiger-focussed. “Pench is a dry and deciduous park,” Chinmay noted. “There’s more room here for tigers to cohabit without getting into conflicts with each other. Unlike Bandhavgarh, where the density of tigers has risen to the point that the cats are competing with each other for territory.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Both Kanha and Pench are tiger reserves but there is a lot more to see here, from the sambar (top left), which can be spied ambling all over the parks, to the Indian scops owl (top right), spotted roosting on trees, jackals (bottom right) and the ubiquitous long-tailed shrike (bottom left). Photos by Riddhi Parekh.\n",
      "\n",
      "For nearly the first three hours of our safari drive next morning, the park seemed unusually silent. Chinmay tailed a few paw marks along mud-strewn trails, snapping his head every time he heard a “call”—signs given out by other animals of a predator in sight.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was 11 a.m. An hour to go before the drive wrapped up. We were settling down for breakfast at Pench’s famous Alikatta square when the Gypsy in front of us revved up and drove off. A knowing glance passed between the guides of both vehicles.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Quick, we have to go,” Chinmay said. Steering his vehicle as fast he could, he rammed us straight into a long dusty lane with lantana outgrowth on both sides. We were late. Ahead, a stream of 4x4s were backed up, one after the other, tourists standing up on the backseats and drivers’ seats looking to one side. “Woh rahi,” one of them shouted. Chinmay stood up, gestured to us, “Look, you see her… Collarwaali?” Unfussed by the hoopla, the tigress had crossed the road, her striped behind disappearing into the bushes.\n",

      "I check my smartphone for the time—11.40 a.m.—before my attention wheels back to the pressing matter at hand: drinking champagne. Six flutes of the finest white wine from Champagne Pannier, a prestigious house in the scenic Marne Valley of France, have been placed in a shapely cluster on a white tabletop. Standing on one side of that table, in an understated white-walled tasting corner in Pannier’s head office in Chateau-Thierry, Eve Masselaert, the brand’s guest relation manager, is setting the stage for the bubbly.\n",
      "\n",
      "She tells my group of five travellers, all of us on a four-day visit to northern France, “This champagne is best had before breakfast… before you even eat anything.” Mildly surprised looks are exchanged. It is nearly time for brunch and I muse silently, “Champagne in the morning is my cup of tea indeed.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The tasting is a coda to our 45-minute tour of Pannier House and its historic underground cellars, limestone quarries dating back to the 12th century that were built to facilitate local construction. In 1937, the son of Louise Eugene Pannier, to whom the Pannier line of champagne started in 1899 is originally credited, purchased these quarries and used them to store and age sparkling wine.\n",

      "Pannier’s cellars hold around four million bottles in different stages of assembling and maturation. Photo courtesy: Northern France Tourism-HRB\n",
      "\n",
      "We had set out earlier in a minivan from the quaint tourist town of Chantilly to Chateau-Thierry, a community in the Champagne province, the drive more than agreeable with sun-kissed vineyards stretching on both sides of the road. Champagne (the wine-growing region in France spread over 34,000 hectares) is ground zero for sparkling wine producers, thanks to its high moisture-retaining terroir—a perfect storm of climate and topography necessary for a good yield. Houses of international repute (Moët & Chandon and Veuve Clicquot among others) are based in the cities of Reims and Epernay, both less than an hour away from Chateau-Thierry.\n",
      "\n",
      "Pannier, one of the suppliers to the French president’s residence—Élysée Palace, has built a niche reputation among connoisseurs, primarily because the house ages its cuvées (the technical term for a type of champagne blend) longer than big-named brands. I had expected Pannier house to be the epitome of ostentation, everything that champagne signifies, but my first impression of the reception area is that of a deliberately muted sophistication. White walls and white flooring, with an unfussy desk and an advertising standee in one corner—the place looked less like the gilded age, more like corporate minimalism.\n",
      "\n",
      "Soon Masselaert arrives to take us through the cellars that lay beyond the main entrance in the lobby. Because the temperature in the caves is more champagne-friendly: 12°C, jackets have to stay on, she instructs. Wearing a black shawl, she leads the way. We fall behind her, first crossing a modest display area of bottles of Pannier in varying sizes, and then entering a labyrinthine underground passage.\n",
      "\n",
      "The rock-walled cellars snake wildly, their jagged surfaces ravaged by time. Every few minutes we encounter racks of dark bottles, carrying wine of different varieties, neatly stacked next to each other. Pannier’s expansive cellars are spread over two kilometres but the tour only covers 300 metres of it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Striding through the dimly lit caves, I reckon it could have served as an apt setting for a swashbuckling Indiana Jones-style adventure or a medieval drama full of intrigue. Real life has come close. “During WWI, the cellars provided refuge to French soldiers and local families from the German invasion,” says Laure Renaud, Pannier’s wine tourism and marketing manager, in an email exchange I have with her after my visit.\n",

      "Chateau-Thierry’s vineyards are known for a high concentration of Pinot Meunier grapes. Photo Courtesy: Northern France Tourism-Vincent Colin\n",
      "\n",
      "There is no drama in the process of creating champagne though, a drink that can propel the wildest, most hedonistic celebratory instincts in the best of us. Quite the opposite, it is a precise and serious art. Masselaert’s words at the tour’s start indicate as much. “There are three main conditions for the ageing and storage of champagne—humidity, darkness and temperature,” she says.\n",
      "\n",
      "Controlling all three generates optimum conditions for the wines to blend. To those uninitiated in oenology, champagne-making can seem complex and long drawn. Our tour includes two different video presentations—one detailing the region’s history with champagne and the other breaking down the steps of making champagne. Broadly, the latter involves blending permutations of three wine varietals—Pinot Noir, Pinot Meunier and Chardonnay. After the initial fermentation, a cuvée of different wines undergoes a second fermentation in a sealed bottle, with yeast and sugar added incrementally. This produces the crucial carbon dioxide needed for the bubbles.\n",
      "\n",
      "Half-way through our visit, Masselaert acquaints us with jargon like “reserve wine”—high-quality wine that is stored for several years and used to blend with wines of younger vintage—and “riddling”—wherein the corked bottles are arranged upside down on A-frames (wooden racks shaped like the alphabet). The inverted bottles are rotated intermittently and aged for a minimum of three years.\n",
      "\n",
      "The venue also hosts dinners and celebrations for special occasions. Photo courtesy: Northern France Tourism-HRB\n",
      "\n",
      "Masselaert’s crash course in champagne production lasts around 30 minutes. At the tasting, she uncorks a white wine champagne from the brand’s prized brut selection. The first hit of the chardonnay packs in a sublime and elegant acidity.There are no performative “oohs” and “aahs” from the group; instead everyone appears to be taking a moment to fully grasp its aftertaste. Needless to say, the drink is top-notch. Masselaert then unveils a rosé with a more fruity, wholesome effect. The white is more to my taste; so after a sip or two of the pink, I reach for it again.\n",
      "\n",
      "In her matter-of-fact mien, Masselaert offers a word to the wise, the next time any of us find ourselves in a room with champagne. “Watch where the bubbles come from,” she says. “If it’s from the bottom of the glass, it’s excellent champagne. If it’s not, then… it’s not good champagne.” And I, for one, am grateful to her for that “bubbly” truth.\n",

      "Visitors can take direct flights to Paris from Indian metro cities. Champagne Pannier’s cellars are located in Chateau-Thierry, which is about 96 km/75 min from Paris.

      "\n",
      "A few days before my brief stay in Paris this September, I was lurking online amongst the good people of the internet, as you do anytime you want your productivity to hit sub-zero levels, when I chanced upon a reddit communiqué. It was an extended rant, which the internet claims proficiency in. “So you’re going to take the metro in Paris this summer,” said the author before launching into a list of around 20 dos and don’ts for the inexperienced visitor.\n",
      "\n",
      "The tips were pithy, useful and couched in exasperated irony. On personal hygiene: “Take a shower, god dammit. If the train is crowded I could end up closer to your body than your girlfriend.” On how to behave: “If you’re not sure whether you’re in the way or not, you’re in the way.” On being lost: “You can ask a Parisian for help but please start with a ‘bonjour.’ We will feel bad about your accent and feel obliged to help you.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Bless the writer’s heart because each time I scurried down the stairs of a train station in the French capital subsequently, those words rang true. My hotel, near the Place de la République square, stood right next to the entry point to République, a stop that served four metro lines. For three days, this was my central command centre to navigate the city.\n",
      "\n",
      "Under République’s white-tiled, brightly lit dome, I would perch myself on a Motte seat (one among different styles of seating architecture in subway stops across Paris) and make my mental calculations, staring at a map of crisscrossing coloured lines. “Switch over from the purple to the pink line. Wait, which one’s the yellow line again? Change three different lines? Hell, no!”\n",
      "\n",
      "In the subterranean world, Paris shed some of its polished sheen. Mass transportation has a way of doing that to even the most advanced of cities.

      "Not that there weren’t signs of elegance and artistry. At Châtelet, a violinist’s mournful rendition of “Habanera” from Carmen almost made me miss my train. The word search mural at Concorde, designed by Francoise Schein to spell out the Declaration of the Rights of Man from the French Revolution, was as much of a time sink. I could have gazed admiringly for hours at Place des Abbesses’s art nouveau iron-and-glass awning on the entrance. But that would have meant climbing the station’s winding staircase—a feat as gruelling as a Stairmaster workout.\n",

      "Within a span of three to four journeys, the metro had become my safe space. Franz Kafka famously observed, “The metro is the best way for foreigners to imagine they’ve a quick, correct grasp of the essence of Paris.” The key, of course, is that it is “imagined”—an illusory feeling of belonging that travel lulls a person into.\n",

      "But in the underground rail system, a refuge of workaday men and women, clueless tourists are an intrusion. Perhaps it’s the result of living in Mumbai, a city full of high-strung commuters, that has made me sensitive to this fragile temperament.\n",
      "\n",
      "So every time I stepped into a train in Paris, the reddit commandments scrolled silently in my mind. My attempt was to be nonchalant and unobtrusive, give the distinct impression that I have been jumping into and out of these metallic grey coaches forever.\n",
      "\n",
      "On one Saturday evening, I had to amend my plans en route to Saint-German following a sudden shower. Sprinting out to the nearest metro stop, I arrived at the ticket gate and forgot a crucial commandment: “Searching for your ticket right in front of the gate is NOT OK.” Eventually, I fished out my ticket from my drenched satchel butafter I had borne the full consternation of my fellow passengers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Obviously I had some distance to go before perfecting the Parisian metro etiquette. To the redditor who had so painstakingly tried, I can only submit a sincere “pardonnez-moi.”\n",

      "Mountain Getaway | Setting up a Hammock in the Himalayas at Shey Bhumi, Leh\n",
      "\n",
      "Shey Bhumi is the kind of place that sends the “panorama” feature on smartphones into overdrive. To be fair, that could also double as an accurate general assessment of Ladakh’s beaten-down and barren magnificence, which seems to evoke inexhaustible astonishment from any vantage point. Shey, in particular though, is unlike many of the other stay options available in Leh, Ladakh’s focal city nestled in the Himalayas. Most hotels or guest houses here are located in and around the central shopping square, and as is wont in so many hinterland towns of India, they strive for urbanity. I, however, was headed to an escape removed from all the hubbub.\n",
      "\n",
      "The communal dining space at Shey Bhumi. Photo Courtesy: Kaya Dorje\n",
      "\n",
      "From the airport, it took nearly 30 minutes for my pick-up to drive past the property’s unfussy iron gates on a narrow road in the tiny hamlet of Chuchot-Yokma. My arrival here had coincided with truant weather. It was supposed to be summertime in Leh—usually a vibrant visual palette of crystal-blue skies and icy peaks bleeding into a landscape of dusty brown slopes and willowy plains. But as I scampered out of my vehicle, I met my worst fear: the steady drizzle of rain and the lashing force of the wind.\n",
      "\n",
      "Shey’s manager Rupesh Sawant, a cheery and gregarious host, was at hand to greet me. Without missing a beat, he glanced up at the skies and chided, “Looks like you brought the Mumbai monsoon with you.” I did not have time to register my disappointment or my surroundings. I was quickly ushered up the steps to the terrace of a traditional Ladakhi structure. Sawant ducked his head to enter a small wooden door and I stepped in behind him.\n",
      "\n",
      "The place I found myself in, located centrally in the property, was once the ruin of an old Ladakhi home, as per Sawant’s recounting. Now restored, it served as Shey’s communal dining area with a kitchen downstairs. I took in some of the newer decorative touches, like the bright red wooden columns hand-painted by local monks and the comfortable floor-seating flanked by antique dining tables. They were adequate as adornments without diminishing from the house’s ancient provenance.\n",
      "\n",
      "Cosy rooms are done up using traditional Tibetan and Ladakhi furniture. Photo Courtesy: Kaya Dorje\n",
      "\n",
      "Breakfast wrapped up, I then made my way to my private cottage, a little farther from the dining hall. Standing in the doorway of what would be my home for the next two days,Shey Bhumi finally came into sharp focus. I was struck by how nature had been allowed to take its own course here with bare minimum interference, even for a property that advertises its rustic bona fides.\n",
      "\n",
      "The six-acre property included 10 cottages, in the local folk mode of a white-stoned square facade with a flat roof, lined with red beams on its borders. As opposed to a manicured landscape neatly designed for a postcard, each cottage was separated by wild grass and uneven bushes of sea buckthorn. Through the grassy outgrowth, there were makeshift wooden paths to each cottage, lined with lanterns intermittently.\n",
      "\n",
      "Inside the cottages, wooden floors, vintage chests, spacious beds with dragon motifs and carvings, subtly reinforced the theme of elegant outback comfort. Still, I imagine what visitors must come to SheyBhumi for was the money shot: a stunning and expansive view of the mountains, which flanked the retreat on all sides. My private cottage opened out to the Zanskar range while from the dining hall, you could spot the Ladakh range. To my dismay, a gloomy, grey filter had been pulled over both these scenes.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was only a day and a half later that I got my photo finish. Sawant had asked me to look out for a trifecta of colours—the azure blue sky, punctuated with snow-capped tips, and muddy tan slopes, sometimes with a hint of purple. Walking out onto my front porch, there it was: the multi-coloured swatch that had eluded me so far. Panorama shot, check.\n",
      "\n",
      "From atop the dining hall terrace, you can spy Thiksay Monastery. Photo by: ~Usergi15632539/Istock\n",
      "\n",
      "There is, of course, more to Shey Bhumi than mountain-gazing. Intermittent rain had played spoiler on my itinerary with the entry by road from Leh to Nubra Valley and Pangon Lake blocked. But I gleaned some cultural enrichment, devoting an entire day to Ladakh’s famed monasteries—Hemis, Thiksay and Spituk—all at a 20-30 minute ride from the property.\n",
      "\n",
      "In retrospect, I am glad because the seclusion only heightened Shey’s faraway appeal. I remember chancing upon Ancient Futures, a treatise on the Ladakhi people by Helena Norberg-Hodge, in the dining hall book collection. Norberg-Hodge celebrated the resilience of Ladakhi people, hoping that the modern life didn’t edge out a simple culture that cherished contentment. During my visit, everything had not gone as I had wanted but in the end, I was certain I left contented.\n",

      "\n",
      "There are moments when the therapeutic benefits of travel can hit home harder than any of the dispassionate advice received on a shrink’s couch. Displacement, in a strictly physical sense, clarifies both mind and body. For Kalki Koechlin, that breakthrough came during a trip to Karuna Farm, a nature retreat near Kodaikanal.\n",
      "\n",
      "Although she can’t quite trace the timeline—it was two-three years ago, she says—the circumstances that accelerated her existential crisis are still vivid. “I was in a state of transition with my divorce and a lot of changes in my personal life,” recalls the actor, alluding to her 2015 parting with filmmaker Anurag Kashyap. “Other things were happening at the time too like illnesses in my family and financial pressures.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Kalki and a girlfriend plotted a quick getaway to the south. “During our time at the farm, we went to the top of a mountain nearby and we did mushrooms. I remember feeling like the universe was breathing with me and that I wasn’t alone. And that everyone was connected.”\n",
      "\n",
      "By the end of her journey, Koechlin had arrived at “practical solutions” to many of her problems. If this flash of satori, Zen-speak for enlightenment, has a Kerouac-ian ring to it, that’s because stripped of her glamorous facade, the 33-year-old exudes the air of a happy beatnik.\n",

      "\n",
      "Koechlin is about to eat so she settles down in a chair, a plate of food in one hand and a glass of wine in the other. Between mouthfuls, she starts to talk travel. “For me, a trip has to fall into my lap. By planning too much, you are forcing yourself to have a good time instead of approaching it like you are going to learn from this experience.”\n",

      "What is your primary motivation to travel?\n",
      "\n",
      "It happens when I am saturated creatively. I can’t read. I can’t concentrate or even learn my lines. When it gets to that, I know I need to travel. It’s kind of like emptying the cup so that you can fill it up again. Before, I used to work like a headless chicken for a year-and-a-half and then suddenly feel like I am a failure. Then I would take four months off. Now I am trying to take shorter breaks but more often.\n",
      "\n",
      "Where did you go on your last break? \n",
      "\n",
      "I went back to my hometown Pondicherry almost two to three weeks ago. I am learning surfing at the Kallialay Surf School on Serenity Beach. I also go horseback riding when I am there, riding horses without saddles and a grip. There’s no way of controlling the horse except communicating with it. I used to ride as a child but stopped completely as an adult. Now I am back on a horse, after almost 12 years.\n",

      "What sort of travel did you do as a child?\n",
      "\n",
      "My dad (Joel Koechlin) hitch-hiked from France to India in his 20s through places like Afghanistan and Varanasi. Travel was a way of life for him, like it was for many people in the 1960s and ’70s. He used to make paragliders, hand gliders and small aircrafts. So my childhood was filled with, you know, jumping off cliffs in a hand glider from the top of the mountain. And then a little later on, I was the one who had to drop him to the top of the mountain in a car and drive down by myself.\n",
      "\n",
      "With my parents, I remember some distinct trips. One was to the Himalayas. That was the first time I ever saw snow. I think I was eight or nine. We used to do a lot of treks in and around Mudumalai near Ooty, where I went to school. Then when I was older, I made my first trip to France to visit my grandparents. They lived near the Vosges Mountains in eastern France and there I learnt to ski. So yeah, I had a country bumpkin upbringing of sorts.\n",
      "\n",
      "When did you start travelling alone?\n",
      "\n",
      "When I was 18, I travelled with my then boyfriend, an English literature student, to Bodh Gaya and Manali among other places. We were both these young boho wanderers in love, going everywhere by train. We had just read Herman Hesse’s Siddhartha and would write poetry together. Then when I was at university in London (Goldsmiths), I travelled alone across Europe to many places. Spain, Amsterdam—of course (smiles knowingly).\n",
      "\n",
      "How do you like solo travel?\n",
      "\n",
      "Initially, I was not good at it. I was socially awkward. I wouldn’t know how to make friends. So my early trips were all about going to museums or reading my book at the beach… being a quiet and a good girl. Now I am better at travelling by myself. Two years ago, I accidentally ended up on a solo trip to Sicily. On the short flight there I made friends with this troupe of classical musicians. They were amazing. They took me to their concerts. Then from there, I went to some of the smaller beach towns near Sicily.\n",

      "Do you plan your travel at all?\n",
      "\n",
      "I always go with the intention of wanting my own space. It’s never about what am I going to do there. I am a nature person so I would much rather go to the mountains and go trekking. But if I am in a place like New York (her favourite city in the world), I want to be watching plays, going to museums, seeing stand-up comedy routines and music festivals. It’s about jumping on the bandwagon of whatever’s going on that week. There’s always someone who connects you to something else. And you find your way. During my recent trip to New York last month, I rode bicycles everywhere. I got to stop where I wanted and see the neighbourhoods properly.\n",
      "\n",
      "In Sicily, for instance, I was at a restaurant and seeing me by myself, the restaurateur began to chat with me. After a while, I was with his family—there were about 20 of them—with a grand matriarch sitting on a table. Somebody was playing the piano and there was all this food. It felt like a scene from The Godfather. I like it when a trip builds on its own organically.\n",
      "\n",
      "You also go on regular road trips.\n",
      "\n",
      "I love it because you have no control over what’s going to happen—you may have a puncture one day or you may not reach a place on time. Then sometimes, you end up in a Kafkaesque situation where some uncle tells you that the rubber for your flat tyre is available somewhere else and you are wheeling the tyre on the road with three kids and a chicken runs across the street from you.\n",

      "In all of this, you are just reminded of life and humanity. You realise that life exists outside your own bubble. And that it’s not the same but it’s equally difficult. People may think that just because someone lives in the mountains they must be so happy but that’s not the case, they have their own struggles. Travel is never about escapism for me.\n",
      "\n",
      "Speaking of the mountains, what do you like about them?\n",
      "\n",
      "Once a year, I try to go to the mountains… Kashmir, the Himalayas, the Northeast or in the south. It’s about the quietude and the vast expanse. My favourite place are the mountains near Karuna Farm, a place I find the spiritual. Whenever I am in the mountains, I am more meditative. If I am there long enough, I start writing. I also like going to Pondicherry to isolate myself and study my scripts closely.\n",
      "\n",
      "What was the most significant trip of your life?\n",
      "\n",
      "It was the visit to Karuna Farm I mentioned earlier. I was in a vulnerable place physically and mentally. At the farm, my friend and I met a guy named Hart, who was an out-and-out hippie, living in a thatched hut and everything. We ended up spending a lot of time with him. He went through a whole bunch of healing experiences with me. I returned to Mumbai with a clear idea of what I needed to do.\n",
      "\n",
      "Going to the mountains might have seemed like I was escaping but at the time, through all the conversations and experiences I had had, I came back with most of the solutions. That was when I decided that from here on, I would travel when I was saturated. It’s like that Buddhist tale about the turtle who yearns to be a dragon. But in order to be one, he has to leave his shell first.\n",
      "\n",
      "So does travel make for a more interesting person?\n",
      "\n",
      "Yeah sure, but not resort or package travel—that makes a person boring. It should be about making yourself available to the world around you rather than taking your world with you. The idea is to step out of your comfort zone and realise that there is something else happening in this world.\n",

      "Airbnb India’s Country Manager Amanpreet Bajaj on Making the World Home\n",
      "\n",
      "Amanpreet Bajaj is by all accounts a busy man, whose job entails taking a flight out to somewhere in this world at least once a month, but he is loath to consider himself a typical business traveller. Instead the India country manager of Airbnb, the online rental platform that has reinvented how people travel since 2008, prefers the new-age concept of “bleisure”. The explanation is self-evident: business trips that also afford some of the joys of unencumbered travel.\n",
      "\n",
      "In a conversation over the phone from his office in Delhi, 36-year-old Bajaj reveals that he had been travelling for work long before Airbnb. “I was lucky because I was a consultant (with Ernst & Young, India) early in my career. Part of that role involved constantly going to a different country to learn. The friends I made when I was in those places ensured that I was made to feel at home,” he says.\n",
      "\n",
      "In his consulting days, Bajaj would spend at least three to four weeks in a foreign location. “I worked through the week and then weekends were spent exploring whichever city or town I was in,” he says. That meant anything from spending hours roaming around Paris to dropping by the best restaurant in Amsterdam or checking out the latest hotspot in New York.\n",
      "\n",
      "Greece is a perennial favourite of Bajaj’s.Photo Courtesy: Amanpreet Bajaj\n",
      "\n",
      "Wanderlust runs in Bajaj’s family. His father owned a transportation business and any downtime was spent taking road trips, often through north India as they drove to meet relatives in Delhi. “My father was the kind of person who wouldn’t just drive from one location to another. He would stop at roadside dhabas, enjoy the sights and love to start a conversation with people. He encouraged me to do the same,” remembers Bajaj.\n",
      "\n",
      "It’s an ethos he has carried through to his dealings today. Thanks to travel, he has also picked up hobbies he never would have considered. Sailing is a fledgling interest. “I wouldn’t have ever considered sailing in India. I experienced it for the first time in Greece and because I had such a wonderful time, I now sail whenever I go there. I find someone who has a boat and we go to one of the islands nearby,” he says.\n",
      "\n",
      "Greece, sunny and postcard perfect, is a perennial favourite with Bajaj. Its genial hospitality and familial culture appeal to his Indian roots. “Greece is like another home to me. Everywhere you look, there are remnants of the country’s ancient history and civilisation. The people are warm and value family ties. And, the cuisine is delightful,” he says. In Athens, Bajaj’s usual stomping grounds are the local flea markets, in and around the city centre, or Brettos, one of the city’s well-known bars. “Brettos is the oldest distillery in Athens that serves ouzo (a traditional Greek aperitif), high quality brandy, and more than 36 different flavours of liqueur, many of which are not available in other establishments,” he reveals.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bajaj’s idea of fulfilling travel isn’t extreme, either in luxury or adventure. He prefers down-to-earth interactions with new faces instead. “Travel is a good way to realise that whatever apprehensions a person might have before he or she goes somewhere, the people they meet are probably thinking the same way. So that presents a great opportunity for cultural exchange and finding common ground,” he says.\n",
      "\n",
      "Switzerland is another favourite destination of Bajaj’s. “The whole country is so picturesque and the people are highly disciplined,” he says. Photo by Boris Stroujko/Shutterstock.\n",
      "\n",
      "Home or how to make people feel at home is a constant motif in his responses perhaps because Airbnb’s equity with travellers around the world depends on it. In November 2015, that skill faced its greatest test after a series of terrorist attacks shook Paris. Bajaj was there that night dining at Flora, along with some Airbnb hosts who were in town for an annual company event.\n",
      "\n",
      "“As soon as the news broke, we went to our Airbnb listing which belonged to a Frenchman,” he remembers. “We spent almost one-and-a-half days in his home trying to locate every employee and making sure they were safe. We couldn’t step outside but the French host was so kind. He called us to let us know that there was enough food in the fridge to last us during our stay there.”\n",
      "\n",
      "For Bajaj, that was a life-affirming moment and, according to him, it’s what travelling comes down to—forming real and authentic connections with strangers. And there’s no substitute for that. “I know that there’s talk these days of Virtual Reality (VR) replacing travel one day but all that will remain a novelty. As long as we are human, we will want to go to a place and feel it in our bones,” he says.\n",
      "\n",
      "Taste Trumps Travel…\n",
      "\n",
      "All of us take cues from our families on how to be or, in many instances, how not to be. When it came to food, I took from mine an open-minded appetite since much of mi familia was found wanting on that front. Anything new or foreign was viewed with wariness, at best, and derision, at worst. So I determined to try my damndest, like Seinfeld’s George Costanza, to do the opposite.\n",
      "\n",
      "In my pre-teens, there was a moment when this contrast came into focus. It was the 1990s; a simpler time when the average Indian palate was tentatively opening up to global influences. The occasion was a relative’s wedding reception with one of those multi-cuisine buffet spreads—mostly Indian and Indianised Chinese.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sometime during the proceedings, a dear uncle of mine (I might have to reconsider that “dear” after this revelation) marched to the buffet line and surveyed his options. A native of Kerala, he had lived in the state all his life and was authoritative, opinionated and possessed of a provincial mind-set, especially in matters of eating.\n",
      "\n",
      "At a counter that said Chinese chilly chicken, he stopped. I watched as he served himself a portion and stuck a forkful into his mouth. His head began to shake slowly and his eyes grew wider. Just like a music video playing in reverse, the fork went back in and out came the sampling.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What the hell is that?” he barked at the server standing behind the counter. The poor man smiled meekly and blurted, “It’s Chinese, sir.” “Well, no wonder it’s terrible,” my uncle shot back. With that sweeping generalisation, he had condemned this alien cuisine as unworthy of his respect.\n",
      "\n",
      "Needless to say, my uncle never did travel to China or, if I am assuming right, even felt compelled to visit a country whose food had produced such a violent reaction in him in the first place.\n",
      "\n",
      "I dredge this history up because at some point in their sojourns, foodies might confront a conundrum: would they travel to a place with a cuisine they don’t care for? A good friend is not the biggest admirer of Kashmiri food or typical Rajasthani fare. Dal baati churma? “Overrated,” she says. Ditto the legendary Kashmiri kahwa. But neither fact will dissuade her from going back to these places, in a heartbeat.\n",
      "\n",
      "I recall another friend, who had a short-lived romance with a dreamy Scot and the dreamier landscape of his country, during whic, she had to fake enthusiasm for Scotland’s famously disagreeable national dish—the haggis (a savoury pudding made of meat, onions, spices and oatmeal and cooked in a sheep’s stomach). Bland Scottish food, however, dimmed in comparison to the beauty of ancient castles and her knight in shining armour.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is significant where your first brush with a new cuisine occurs. In India, anything international is often diluted by fanciful contemporary trends or gauche local touches. And that early impression may leave some indisposed to a particular kind of food. Or worse, if you never try the real thing, you may forever live in blissful oblivion of what you are missing out.\n",
      "\n",
      "A few years ago, an acquaintance at whose home I had enjoyed many an Italian meal, travelled to Naples. Upon her return, I found that her white sauce-drenched penne, slathered in cheese, had changed. Her sauce was now a blanched tomato reduction, with only a hint of herbs, and plain olive oil. Over lunch, she then declared what a novice she had been all along, saying, “Things are done so simply in Italy. Indian continental places are the worst.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The proliferation of international cuisine restaurants has understandably fuelled a horde of poor parodies, which are not the greatest gateway into authenticity. A recent trip to Pattaya altered another pal’s view of the Tom Yum Soup that was served back home. “I haven’t ordered it at all since I returned from the trip,” she told me.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some of you, who are quite content with the native Tom Yum, may judge people like her to be purists but that is a natural side-effect of travelling extensively. The traveller’s heart hankers after genuine experiences. Cuisines will disappoint and delight in equal measure. It’s wandering into the unknown that is the real thrill.\n",
